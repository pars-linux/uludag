This file is intended to simplify translators work. It points to the
translatable resources in Pardus Control Center and its modules, then
explains their translation methods in a prioritized order. All
translators of Tasma are advised to use this map.

==> tasma/po/tasma.pot

This is a standart po file with Pardus Control Center's main
user interface messages.

==> tasma/applnk/*.directory

These .desktop like files describe the left side main group
menus of Tasma.

Add a Name tag for your language. Something like Name[xx]=blah blah
where xx is your two letter language code.

==> tasma/applnk/desktop/*.desktop

Menu files for the right side of control center. They describe
KDE's own control modules. Pardus specific control modules carry
their desktop files on their own packages.

Add a Name and Comment tag for your language. You can optionally
translate Keywords tags too.

==> package-manager/src/*.desktop
==> package-manager/po/package-manager.pot

Menu and user interface messages for Pardus package manager.

==> network-manager/network-manager.desktop
==> network-manager/network-applet.desktop
==> network-manager/po/network-manager.pot

Menu and user interface messages for Pardus network manager.

==> service-manager/src/service-manager.desktop
==> service-manager/po/service-manager.pot

Menu and user interface messages for Pardus service manager.

==> disk-manager/src/disk-manager.desktop
==> disk-manager/po/disk-manager.pot

Menu and user interface messages for Pardus disk manager.

==> user-manager/po/user-manager.pot
==> user-manager/user-manager.desktop

Menu and user interface messages for Pardus user manager.
Note that group descriptions are taken from Çomar, and you
have to translate them in there instead of this module.

==> package-manager/help/
==> network-manager/help/
==> user-manager/help/
==> service-manager/help/
==> disk-manager/help

These modules also have an online help facility. If you finished
other translation jobs, and have free time, you can add a new folder
with your two letter language code in those folders, and put a
translated main_help.html file there.
