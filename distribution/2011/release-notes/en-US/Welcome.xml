        <title>What is Pardus?</title>
        <para>
            Pardus is a Linux distribution developed as a product of the Pardus Project, by National
            Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE), which is under the Scientific
            and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and by volunteered contributors.
            It is named after the Latin (and scientific) name for the Anatolian leopard, Panthera pardus tulliana.
        </para>
        <para>
            The aim of the Pardus distribution is to offer people a stable, reliable, easy-to-use and
            feature-rich computer experience by providing modern and popular open-source software. The
            developers are also putting an additional effort to make Pardus run on a wide range of
            hardware.

        <title>How Can I Try Pardus?</title>
        <para>
            You can try Pardus either by installing it on your computer or running the Live version
            without touching your hard disk. You can boot Pardus from an optical drive as well as from
            USB mass storage devices like external hard drives and USB flash drives.
        </para>
        <para>
            Both the installation and live version images exceeds the size of a regular CD
            so if you are willing to use an optical drive for booting Pardus, you currently have to
            use DVD media to burn the images.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that the boot order in your system's BIOS software should be set with the optical drive
            or USB mass storage device as the first device in order to boot from the installation or
            the live medium. On newer systems, the boot order can also be changed by pressing a key
            (generally F8 on desktop systems) while booting.
