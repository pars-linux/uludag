Converting PO
-------------

Once the translation deadline is reached, the PO files must be
converted into the multiple-PO format required by Publican.  The
gettext library already has utilities to do this -- in particular,
msgmerge and msgattrib.  The 'msgmerge' command will be used to
extract the matching translations from the single, large PO file that
apply to each separate, smaller PO file for Publican.  The 'msgattrib'
utility will be used to strip out the many non-applicable
translations, which otherwise would sit at the end of each separate PO
file as "obsolete" messages.  (In other words, without 'msgattrib',
the size of each separate PO file would be about the same as the
single PO file, which is highly undesirable.)

#!/bin/bash
#
# Turn all single PO into separate PO for Publican
# * Relies on po/LINGUAS to be correct!
# * Make sure you're in the top of the module with the 'po/' folder.

for LANG in `cat po/LINGUAS`; do
    for POTFILE in pot/*.pot; do
    	msgmerge po/${LANG}.po ${POTFILE} | msgattrib --no-obsolete \
		 > ${LANG}/$(basename ${POTFILE} .pot).po
    done
done
#------------------------------ THE END

Now rename all the language directories to Publican friendly names
(e.g. "fr" -> "fr-FR").

Then upate the OTHER_LANGS definition in the Makefile to include all
languages, and remove the '#' comment symbol so that it is read by
Publican.
