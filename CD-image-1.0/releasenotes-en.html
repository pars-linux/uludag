<p>
Welcome to Pardus, an easy to install and use system, with many enhancements
to desktop usability, compatibility and security. With Pardus, you can 
connect to Internet, read your e-mails, securily communicate with
your friends and exploit your computer's multimedia capability by listening
to music and watching movies. We kindly invite you to
<a href=http://www.uludag.org.tr/eng>http://www.uludag.org.tr/eng</a>
to explore new Pardus opportunities. 
</p>

<p>
<h2>Basic system requirements</h2>
While Pardus will work on any modest hardware, we recommend that you 
have 512 Mb of RAM and 1200 Mhz CPU. While these are two very basic 
conditions to let Pardus work in an effective way, minimum requirements can be set 
as follows:

<p>
<div class="box">
256 Mb of RAM (<b>512 Mb recommended</b>) <br>
800 Mhz Intel or AMD CPU (<b>at least 1200 MHz recommended</b>) <br>
</div>

<p>

We also recommend an internet connection to reach Pardus update services and 
download many other productivity software.
<p>

A sound card will automatically be detected and used after you install Pardus. 
You will need to configure your printer with a straightforward process 
in your first login.

<h2>What's new in 1.0?</h2>

 The project developers have been working hard on
Pardus for your desktop pleasure. Below, you can find the most notable
and interesting new ideas and features of Pardus 1.0.

<h3>PiSi: New packaging system</h3>

has its own characteristics and advantages over other package managers. 
With PiSi, developers can enjoy packaging new software in an efficient way. 
End users will get comfortable with PiSi's fast and hassle-free software
installation interface. With a few clicks, you can easily search for utilities
you need and install it on your disk.

Pardus comes with 2.6.14 kernel with additional improvements and bug 
fixes to the stock kernel. Therefore, you will benefit from new 
hardware drivers and performance enhancements.



<h3>OpenOffice.org 2.0 office suite</h3>

 
For your office software needs, Pardus includes an amazing
software, OpenOffice.org which can open and save Microsoft Office 
files. OpenOffice.org's new version, 2.0, has been used widely
on both Windows and Linux. You can use OpenOffice.org 2.0's 
word processor, spreadsheet, presentation and database software
without breaking your compatibility with other office files. 
We have prepared more clip-arts, templates and extensions to this 
version for your pleasure.
