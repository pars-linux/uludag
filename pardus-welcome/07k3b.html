Burn CD's or DVD's in a matter of seconds

K3b is a CD and DVD burning application for Linux systems optimized for
KDE. It provides a comfortable user interface to perform most CD/DVD
burning tasks, such as creating an audio CD from a set of audio files or
copying a CD.

While the experienced user can influence all steps of the
burning process, the beginner may find comfort in the automatic settings
and the reasonable defaults which allow a quick start.
