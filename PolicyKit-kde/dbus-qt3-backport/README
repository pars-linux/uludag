This is a backport of Harald Fernengel's Qt4 D-Bus bindings.

Some Qt4 based code had no direct equivalent in Qt3. Cases where this
transition to Qt3 might not be fully correct are marked with FIXME-QT4

Depending on the use case it might be necessary to extend QDBusMesssage
to allow marshalling/de-marshalling based on an application provided
helper as the Qt3 QVariant can not handle all cases the Qt4 pendant can
(user defined types, etc)
