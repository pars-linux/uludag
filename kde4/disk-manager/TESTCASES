- Mount an external usb stick or an other similar device.
    - Type console
        # mount
        Observe that the mounted disks and  the mounted points of these disks listed on the disk-manager screen are correct.

    - Try to change the mount point of this disk
        - Type console
            # mount
            Observe that newly changed mount point is applied to appropriate disk.
        And observe that the previous mount point of this disk is unmounted. (This means that the previous mount point is removed from the output of command "mount".)
        - Try to mount this disk to home directory.
            Observe whether the disk manager gives a warning message about this unvalid mount point.
    - Try to change the filesystem type
        - Type console 
            # blkid
            For a selected device, observe that the default filesystem type on disk-manager is the same with the output of "blkid".
        - Change the filesystem type:
            Observe that if this filesystem type is not suitable with this device, disk-manager gives a warning message about it.

    - Try to add an option for mounting
        - If the option part is empty try to change the settings. 
            Observe that it gives a warning about it.
        - If you add some option to option part,
            Observe that the output of the command "mount" contains this option for the related disk.

- Try to mount the root partition
    Observe that it gives a warning about it can not remount.
        Not : the mount point of root should be "/".

- Observe whether an extended partition listed on disk-manager screen. (Normally it can not be listed.)
