Network Manager
---------------

Network Manager is a handy tool to manage all ethernet, wireless and modem
settings. It's designed to be useful in mind, easily connecting to a
desired network point in a matter of seconds. The application is written using
Python and Qt libraries.

Network Manager is tightly connected with COMAR, the configuration manager of
Pardus. If you want to test or use Network Manager, you need to follow these
steps to run.

1. Checkout COMAR.

  svn co http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/comar

2. Go into COMAR directory 

  cd path/comar/comar

3. Install COMAR 

  scons install prefix=/

4. Install COMAR's Python API 
  
  cd ../api && python setup.py install

5. Checkout network-configurator and install. Note that PyQT/PyKDE and PyKDE extensions
are needed.

  svn co http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/tasma/network-manager
  cd network-manager
  python setup.py install
 
6. Run COMAR Daemon 

  comard 

7. Register needed comar scripts. For wireless communication, run 

  wget http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/wireless-tools/comar/link.py
  hav register System.Package `pwd/link.py`

For ethernet communication, run

  wget http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/net-tools/comar/link.py
  hav register System.Package `pwd/link.py`

Now you can use Network Manager hopefully without a problem. Should you need any
help, please contact the author.
