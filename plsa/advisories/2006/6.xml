        <Description xml:lang="en">
            <p>Teemu Salmela discovered that the Links character-mode web-browser performs
              insufficient sanitising of URLs based on the smb scheme, which might lead to the
              execution of arbitrary shell commands. The problem is triggered by some shell meta
              characters in URLs starting with smb:// on GET and PUT requests.</p>
