Areas to Contribute
===================

In this section, we'll briefly cover the different areas to contribute.

*********************

Our project has a test team in order to test the new releases of Pardus distributions and also test packages which will go to stable repositories.

For contributor applications: :ref:`how-to-be-contributor`


***************************
Bug reporting and triaging
***************************

Pardus bug reports are tracked in bugzilla. You can examine bugs to determine whether or not they have enough information and feedback to be worked on and assign a priority/component/product to them as soon as possible.

To know that the very same bug exists in other distributions might help us to produce a proper solution. If the problem is solved -or never existed- in another distribution, reaching a solution will be faster by examining the work that the particular distribution did for that software.

Detailed bug triaging documentation can be found from :ref:`bugtracking-index`, it will guide you through the mechanisms and the workflows commonly used in bugzilla and bug triaging approaches.

In order to help triaging bugs, you have to be able to find them. You can find about new bug reports by subscribing to the bugzilla `e-mail list <http://lists.pardus.org.tr/mailman/listinfo/bugzilla>`_.

Our bug tracking system can be reached via http://bugs.pardus.org.tr. Just create an account and you'll be immediately able to report new bugs and write comments to the existing bug reports. You don't need an account for browsing current bug reports.


***********
Translation
***********

Pardus officially supports 11 languages: Turkish, English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, Swedish, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese.

The goal of the localization team is to bring everything around Pardus closer to local communities (countries and languages). Usually this involves doing translations of Pardus tools, websites and documentations and improving their quality.

A collaborative meeting point for Pardus translators is the ``pardus-translators`` `e-mail list <http://lists.pardus.org.tr/mailman/listinfo/pardus-translators>`_.

More information and statistics can be found in Pardus translation project's `website <http://translate.pardus.org.tr>`_. The translator applications can also be done from `there <http://translate.pardus.org.tr>`_. 

More details about Pardus Translations :ref:`introduction-to-translation`.

**************
Documentation
**************

You can support the documentation of the ongoing projects and different development content. Along with the end user documents, you can also prepare *HOWTO* documents for the users/contributors that have newly joined the project.

The `wiki <http://pardus-wiki.org>`_ and `Özgürlük İçin <http://www.ozgurlukicin.com/>`_ for Pardus is a nice place to start helping for the documentation.

You can also enrich the content of this `developer web page <http://developer.pardus.org.tr>`_. Currently, only people with an SVN account have write permissions to the content.

*******************************
Graphical design and multimedia
*******************************

If you are talented in this domain, you can help with the topics which require graphics knowledge, such as the icon sets, font types and colour themes. Feel free to ask for help from us via e-mail lists when you need visual materials to use in your work.
