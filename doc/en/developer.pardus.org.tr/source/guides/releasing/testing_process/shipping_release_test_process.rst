Shipping Release Test Process
=============================

After the pre-alpha period (bootstrapping and generation of nightly builds),
Pardus goes through all development cycles.

The official releases of Pardus are Alpha, Beta, RC (Release candidate) and Final
releases.

The releases excluding Final Release, are the official test releases of Pardus.
Therefore help for these release before shippment has an incredible value for
Pardus.

These releases have some acceptance criteria in order to be shipped and be
official. These criterias depend the related releases expectations. So these
release criterias should be met before each of them goes offical.

Test team should control and tests whether these criterias are met:

#. `Alpha release expectations and criterias`_
#. `Beta release expectations and criterias`_
#. `Final release expectations and criterias`_


The desktop and installation validation tests should also be done before each
release are shipped.
