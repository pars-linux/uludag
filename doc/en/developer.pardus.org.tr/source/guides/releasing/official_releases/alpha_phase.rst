Alpha Release
-------------

:Author: Semen Cirit
:Last Modified Date: |today|
:Version: 0.2

The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the phase to begin software
testing and takes about 3 months. About 2 months for Alpha 1 and 4 weeks
for Alpha 2 and 3.

At the end of the alpha phase, software should be `feature complete`_, indicating
that no more features will be added to the software. A feature complete version
of a software is not yet final, (it has lots of bugs) but contains all intended
functionality of the final version.

All new package additions should be finish before feature freeze time.

According to this feature completeness, string freeze is also realized..

During this phase Alpha release `tracker bugs`_ should also be fixed.

For the packages, `urgent package list`_ is created periodically and put as text
file under `package source repository`_ `devel branch`_.
These packages are updated to required versions and merged to `package source
repository`_ at given period and time.

As we can see during alpha phase rapid changes occur and so the software can be
unstable and could cause crashes or data loss.
