End of Life
============

Releases for which updates are no longer provided are considered to be
unmaintained and thus end of life or commonly referred to as EOL. It is
recommended to upgrade a recent version of Pardus at this point.

Each short term support Pardus release is maintained about 1 year and
during this time there will be security and critical fixes. The EOL announce
date of a release is next release + 2 month (n + 2).

For long term support releases, the maintainence is about 4 years, the last
one year only security fixes are held.

At the end of this maintenance period, Pardus reaches its end of life.

This document explains the steps for which a release has reached EOL status.

EOL Goals
*********

Warn users and contributors about the ending time of the maintained release
and give a recommendation for the upgrade to the new release of Pardus.

Bugzilla Tasks

Pardus does not track or review bugs for releases where there will be no more
updates, that means which reaches its EOL.

All open bugs about the EOL release is controlled. If they are not reproducible
on the current release, they will be closed with the below message:

    and the current bug reports concerning Pardus X will become invalid. If you can
    still reproduce the bug on Pardus Y, you can reopen the bug and update the version
    information. Thanks.

Also the `tracker bugs`_ related to release will be closed. (alfa, beta, RC, final release blockers.)

-------------

All opened issues should be closed or moved to new release issues on `Pardus tracker`_.


About 6 months after EOL
########################

Packages Web Site Tasks
-----------------------

The package informations about the release that reaches its end of life will be
removed from the packages web site.
