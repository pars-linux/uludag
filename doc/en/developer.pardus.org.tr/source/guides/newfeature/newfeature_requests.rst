Why this process is important and why should I care?
====================================================

The new feature requests is the improvements not only for Pardus but also for the whole world. The interaction between the user and the developer (the feedback and suggestions) is a big opportunity in order to evaluate and improve Pardus.

This kind of process for new features, is very important for following the status and timelines of new features. Before the execution of this process, some undecided new features was wanted to added in last second of the new release and it caused to extend the deadline of the release.

Pardus Linux Distiribution intend to use a predictable release schedule. Related to this, the new feature policy has also a timeline. Periodically reviewed of new features is increase the predictability of the release schedule.

Defining Features on Bugzilla has many advantages:

   #. The reported features from bugzilla can be followed simply and enable everyone in order to give suggestions, comments and feedback.
   #. The volunteers can simply deal with these features.
   #. Testers can get some idea from the report status and can build up experience and knowledge about the feature area.
   #. It creates an excitement what's being worked on.
   #. It avoids suprises at the end.
   #. It says what we are going to do.
   #. It simplyfies to create release notes, all have to do is to filter bugs with "RESOLVED/FIXED" status and "newfeature"  severity.
   #. Media and press can benefit also from these reports.


What is an Enhancement?
=======================

An enhancement can be expressed as an improvement suggested in order to use a feature more effectively and agreeably.

What is a Feature?
==================

A feature can be expressed as a significant change or enhancement for the new release of Pardus.

A feature can be formalize with the following notions:

    #. For sofware that Pardus developers lead:
        #. a significant usability change.(Excluding theme and style changes)
        #. a highly necesssary user requirement
    #. For upstream software:
        #. Be in contact with the upstream developer and request for new feature or change
        #. Working  with the upstream developer about a specific feature.
    #. It should be clear enough that if not completed properly or without a proper backup plan could delay the release
    #. It should be important enough to put as a task in release notes.
    #. It should be exist a group of people that consider this feature as a necessity.
    #. It should not impose a burden to user:
        For example the change should not effect a configuration file in the system and enforce the user to change it manually after updates.
    #. Do not confuse new package requests with new feature requests.
    #. Update request of a package can not be a feature request.
