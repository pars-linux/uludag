<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<a name="about"></a>
<h3>1.1 About this document</h3>

<p>
PiSi (Packages Installed Successfully as Intended) (pronounced <i>pee-see</i>) is the package management system of <a href="http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng" target=_blank">Pardus</a>.

<h4>Some distinctive features of PiSi are listed below: </h4>
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Implemented in Python, </li>
    <li> Small, efficient and robust, </li>
    <li> Source packages are written(or defined) using XML and Python, </li>
    <li> Powerful dependency resolving mechanism, </li>
    <li> An API (Application Programming Interface) on top of which developers can create their custom tools and applications, </li>
    <li> A comprehensive CLI (Command Line Interface) and a user-friendly GUI written in Qt(distributed separately as package-manager), </li>
    <li> Extremely simple and fast package construction, </li>
    <li> and many more.. </li>
</ul>

<p>This document assumes that you have Pardus (?2008) installed and running without problem.</p>

<h2>2. The Concepts</h2>

<a name="whats-a-pms"></a>
<h3>2.1 What's a package management system?</h3>

<p class="first">
    <em>A package management system is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing software packages from a computer. Linux and other Unix-like systems typically manage thousands of discrete packages.</em><a href="#key-0">[0]</a>
</p>

<p class="first">
 With thousands of packages to maintain, most important part of any distribution is indeed its package management system. PiSi is the package management system of Pardus, written from scratch in Python. Our purpose of a new package management design was not reinvent the wheel but to create a new kind of wheel that takes distinctive ideas from existing ones with also easy integration and maintenance in mind.
</p>

<a name="needs-for-a-new-pms"></a>
<h3>2.2 The needs for a new package management system</h3>

<p class="first">
Before deciding to write a new package management system, we considered using the existing ones. Three(UPDATE) years ago when the Pardus project was started, RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) had many problems <a href="#key-1">[1]</a>. One of the bigger problems was also not having one upstream to work with. It was still a work in progress in 2006 <a href="#key-2">[2]</a>.
</p>

<p class="first">
As for DPKG (Debian package management system), despite the fact that it had a much better state than RPM and having a single upstream, we had found its architecture hard to work on. Package preparation is cumbersome and complicated and also some decisions like "interactive package installation" wasn't the ideas that we would support for our distribution. The installation of any package should just be done without confusing the user with configuration internals of any package. The user should only choose and install the package. Configuration should not be a job for a package system. Moreover, as it was stated in a discussion made years ago, its code had become brittle <a href="#key-3">[3]</a>.

<p class="first">
The package management system in our mind should ease the package creation task for developers and contributors, and should pave the way for working with binary packages. For the former, Gentoo's portage had some good ideas. So at the end, we decided to design PiSi with all the advantages of the ones over each other and write it in Python. As all other components of the distribution were going to be written in Python, it would also be much easier to integrate to those parts and prototyping phase would be much much faster.
