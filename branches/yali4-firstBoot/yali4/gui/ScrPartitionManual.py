Pardus can be installed on a variety of hardware. You can install Pardus
on an empty disk or hard disk partition. <b>An installation will automatically
destroy the previously saved information on selected partitions. </b>
</p>
<p>
In order to use Pardus, you must create one Linux filesystem (for the 
system files), which is mandatory and a swap space 
(for improved performance), which is optional. This swap space 
is used whenever system needs more memory, but the system lacks it.
We advise you to allocate at least 4 GBs of hard disk area and 
swap space (between 500 MB - 2 GB, according to your needs) for 
convenience. A Linux partition size less than 3.5 GB is not allowed.
You may also optionally use another disk partition for storing 
user files.
</p>
<p>
You need to format a Linux partition, if it's used for the first time.
You can enable \'Use available free space\' option, if the hard disk's 
remaining space is to be used automatically.
</p>
<p>
The partition table shows the device, size, partition type and
filesystem information. If the partition will be formatted during
Pardus installation stage, then the corresponding \'Format\' 
column will be enabled.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to Pardus Installing and Using Guide for more information
about disk partitioning.
