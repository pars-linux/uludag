</div>
<p>

Firewall Manager is used to define port blocking rules about
communication between computer systems. These rules block or
allow a connection attempt. These attempts may be either made by
your system or a remote system. You can configure these rules via
Firewall Manager.

</p>

<p>

Below there is a list of what you can do with Firewall Manager.
Also some short explanation will be given about how you can do these
operations. However, before mentioning these operations and
their explanation some general explanation about Firewall Manager
will be told.

</p>
<p>

Firewall Manager defines a number of rules and saves them.
These rules are handled differenetly for incoming and outgoing connections.
While incoming connections mean a connection attempt from remote computer to
your computer, otugoing connections mean a connection attempt from your
computer to remote computer. You can follow incoming and outgoing connection rules
from the tab view at the center of the Friewall Manager window. At this tab view
there are two tabs for incoming and outgoing connections and there is a list in
these tabs taht lists the rules.

</p>
<p>

When the Firewall Manager starts, the tab view will be enabled and saved rules in the
system will be loaded to lists. Once the Friewall Manager is stopped the tab view
will be disabled and and lists will be emptied. Stopping the Firewall Manager
does not destroy your defined rules. Firewall Manager stores them in the system
and when you start it again you can see these rules.

</p>
<p>

There are two types of rules in Firewall Manager. First type is 'Default Rules'. Default
rules are defined by the system and they list some specific service ports. It is not possible
to delete or edit default rules. We can only change running status of these rules. Running
status can be running or stopped. Firewall Manager applies running default rules.
Stopped default rules have no effect. Default rules are on the top of the lists and they
are written in bold. And the second type is 'User Defined Rules'. These rules are added
by the users. Delete and edit operations are defined on these rules but because of there is no
running status for user defined rules it is not possible to run or stop them. If you do not
want it in list you can delete it.

</p>

<ul>
    <li><h2>Starting Firewall Manager</h2></li>
    <p>
    If the Firewall Manager is not started in your system, you can start it by clicking
    the 'Start Firewall' button at the top of the window. When a firewall is started it
    starts to apply defined rules. If a process in your system tries to open a blocked port,
    system will prevent it. Similarly, if a remote system tries to connect a blocked port
    on your system, your system will prevent it too.
    </p>
    <li><h2>Stopping Firewall Manager</h2></li>
    <p>
    If the Firewall Manager is started in your system, you can stop it by clicking
    the 'Stop' button at the top of the window. Once the firewall is stopped, it does
    not apply any rules.
    </p>
    <li><h2>Editing Incoming Connection Rules</h2></li>
    <p>
    These are the rules restrict access to your system from remote systems. Firewall Manager
    blocks every connection attempt by default. In this section, allowed ports are chosen.
    Once a port is allowed, remote systems can access to your system over this port.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to edit incoming connection rules click the 'Incoming Connections'
    tab while firewall is started. Below is a list what you can do about editing
    rules via Firewall Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adding a New Rule</li>
        <p>
        Click '+' button at the right side of the top of the rule list. Then New Rule
        dialog appears. Wrtie a single port number to add only one port to your rule.
        If you want to define a rule that contains a port range instead of a single port
        use '-' character to separate them. After writing port or port range, click 'OK'
        button to add new rule. Do not forget this newly added rule will not be saved
        until you apply changes.
        </p>
        <li>Deleting User Defined Rules</li>
        <p>
        Select the rule you want to delete from the rule list. Click the 'X' button
        at the right side of the top of the rule list. Apply changes in order to save.
        </p>
        <li>Editing User Defined Rules</li>
        <p>
        Select the rule you want to edit from the rule list. Click the configure button
        at the right side of the top of the rule list. Edit dialog appers, change the port
        value from this dialog. You can add a single port or a port range similar to adding
        operation. Click 'OK' button to submit. Apply changes in order to save.
        </p>
        <li>Starting and Stopping Default Rules</li>
        <p>
        In order to stop a running default rule or start a stopped default rule
        select the rule from the rule list. Click the leftmost button at the right side
        of the top of the rule list. If the selected rule is running it stops, otherwise
        it starts. According to selected rule's status button's icon changes so you can
        follow wheter a rule is started. Also you can realize rule's status from the icon
        near the list view item.
        </p>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <li><h2>Editing Outgoing Connection Rules</h2></li>
    <p>
    These are the rules restrict your system's connections over a port. If a process
    in your system tries to open a connection with the listed (blocked) ports in this
    section, it will be blocked.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to edit outgoing connection rules click the 'Outgoing Connections'
    tab while firewall is started. Things that you can do are similar to topic that
    was written for incoming connections so we will not discuss the same topics in here.
    You can see these topics above under the title of 'Editing Incoming Connection Rules'.
    </p>
    <li><h2>Saving an Cancelling the Changes</h2></li>
    <p>
    After making some changes via Firewall Manager if you want to make these changes
    permanent click 'OK' or 'Apply' button. If you click the 'Cancel' button, all changes
    you made will be lost since you open Firewall Manager.
    </p>
</ul>
