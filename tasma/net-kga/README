Net-kga, the network configurator for Pardus 
--------------------------------------------

Net-kga is a handy tool to manage all ethernet, wireless and modem
settings. It's designed to be useful in mind, easily connecting to a
desired network point in a matter of seconds. Net-kga is written using
Python and Qt libraries.

Net-kga is tightly connected with COMAR, the configuration manager of
Pardus. If you want to test or use net-kga, you need to follow these
steps to run net-kga.

1. Checkout COMAR.

  svn co http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/comar

2. Go into COMAR directory 

  cd path/comar/comar

3. Install COMAR 

  scons install prefix=/

4. Install COMAR's Python API 
  
  cd ../api && python setup.py install

5. Checkout Net-KGA and install. Note that PyQT/PyKDE and PyKDE extensions
are needed for net-kga

  svn co http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/net-kga/ 
  cd net-kga 
  python setup.py install
 
6. Run COMAR Daemon 

  comard 

7. Register needed comar scripts. For wireless communication, run 

  wget http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/wireless-tools/comar/link.py
  hav register System.Package `pwd/link.py`

For ethernet communication, run

  wget http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/devel/system/base/net-tools/comar/link.py
  hav register System.Package `pwd/link.py`

Now you can use net-kga hopefully without a problem, if any further help
