** Forking from kde **

- forking kcontrol modules... we need to fork and "restructure"/"rewrite?"
  some of kcontrol modules. 

** Other coding issues **

- some kind of help system. showing a modules descriptive information (help)
  is a must!

** Graphical Requirements **

- some of the (missing/ugly)icons for configuration modules must be changed.
