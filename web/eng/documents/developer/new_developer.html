<!--TOC section Introduction-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc1">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H2><!--SEC END -->

In this document we'll try to explain how contributers can support
the Pardus Liux, which is developed under the structure of Pardus
Project, and the requirements to be a Pardus developer. Although we
are talking about the Pardus development model in particular, we believe
that the requirements explained in the document apply to almost all
distribution projects.<BR>
<BR>
Please feel free to browse the web pages of Pardus for other information
not contained in this document. From those pages you may find the
information needed on other documents, tools used and services. Pardus
pages can be reached from <A HREF="http://www.pardus.org.tr"><TT>http://www.pardus.org.tr</TT></A><BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section What is a developer?-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a developer?</H2><!--SEC END -->

To put it roughly, it is not wrong to say that the project should
fulfill two types of mission. As it is the case for any distribution,
gathering the software and preparing the infrastructure to enable
this task and sustaining it, as well as developing new tools and technologies
to form the soul of the distribution are among the required tasks.<BR>
<BR>
When referring to <EM>developer</EM> we describe not only those who
write programs but also those who fulfill any single task. We
are aware that work has to be done in many areas such as documentation,
bug controls, visual materials, translations etc. besides programming
to implement a software project. We need all of them for Pardus as
well.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection How will I start?-->

<H3>How will I start?</H3><!--SEC END -->

First of all its a good idea to keep up with current events. To do
this its mostly effective to observe for a while and watch how work
proceeds. It might be useful to join the e-mail lists which can be
accessed from the Pardus web pages and follow the discussions, ongoing
events, investigate bug reports, the solutions proposed regarding
the bugs and examine the documents published.<BR>
<BR>
By considering the outlined methods you may continue to help development.
You can add your comments and proposals for solutions to the bug reports
by testing the sofware or you can report the new bugs you found. You
can contribute to develop innovative technologies and add new features
or you can support a step of the process which you think is not working
(maybe working too slow) and speed it up. By doing so, you should
always be in communication with other developers and contributers.
As its true for all tasks performed by more than one person, we need
to have knowledge of each other. <BR>
<BR>
Our needs can be summarized as the articles below:<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Developing software and debugging-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc3">2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing software and debugging</H3><!--SEC END -->

You can contribute your knowledge and labour on developing software
by assisting with cleaning up the source and helping innovative technology
teams working in this field. They can provide the best information
on how you can help them. The Pardus e-mail lists which you can join
via <A HREF="http://liste.pardus.org.tr/mailman/listinfo"><TT>http://liste.pardus.org.tr/mailman/listinfo</TT></A> will be helpful.<BR>
<BR>
You may examine the reported bugs, and find solutions for them, using
Pardus bug tracking system which can be accessed via the web pages.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Translation-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc4">2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation</H3><!--SEC END -->

Localization of free software, to enable them to be used with correct
and perfect Turkish is another requirement for us. In this context,
you may work with localization teams organized for almost all major
free software project. We'll draw direct benefit from your support
for localization projects if you give priority to the software selected
by Pardus project. <BR>
<BR>
To say in short, support localization efforts. Beyond rough translations
try to improve the quality of translations. While supporting translation
works, by providing not only Ulusal Dağıtım but also all existing
Linux distributions with packages in problem-free Turkish, you will
be part of an important mission.<BR>
<BR>
To support notable translation groups, you can reach the localization
works you feel interest in via <A HREF="http://www.pardus.org.tr/projeler/turkce/y10me/"><TT>http://www.pardus.org.tr/projeler/turkce/y10me/</TT></A>
(in Turkish)<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Tests and bug reports-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc5">2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests and bug reports</H3><!--SEC END -->

You can report bugs by testing the software we choose. You can controle
the bugs in other distributions and report the situation. To know
that the very same bug exists in other distributions might help us
to produce a proper solution. If that problem is solved -or never
existed- in a particular distribution, reaching a solution will be
faster by examining the work that particular distribution did for
that software. You can reach our bug tracking system via <A HREF="http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/"><TT>http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/</TT></A><BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Graphical Design, Multimediea-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc6">2.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphical Design, Multimediea</H3><!--SEC END -->

If you are talented in this domain, you can help with the topics which
require graphics knowledge, such as the icon sets, font types and
colour themes. Feel free to ask for help from us via e-mail lists
when you need visual materials to use in your work.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Documentation-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc7">2.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation</H3><!--SEC END -->

You can support the documentation of the ongoing projects. Along with
the user's documents you can prepare ``How To'' documents for
the developers that have newly joined the project. You can assist
us to update our Web pages or you can help us to keep foreign language
-such as English, German, Spanish- translations of our pages up-to-date.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Publicity-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc8">2.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity</H3><!--SEC END -->

You can support the publicity of the project and encourage more people
to learn about it.<BR>
<BR>
Probably the list of the topics you can help is not limited with those
above. By rendering your opinions on the discussion points within
e-mail lists, advancing proposals, providing the lists with constructive
criticism and developments related with the distribution, you can
find new topics to help.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section What is the responsibility of the developer?-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc9">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the responsibility of the developer?</H2><!--SEC END -->

Indeed, the answer of this question might vary considerably depending
on the subject you begin to work on, but we can mention the basic
responsibilities of all developers in general. In fact, the responsibilities
described here are basic points for many developer to work together
in harmony. In this sense, although what is mentioned below is true
in general, you can find your own way to cooperate as you become familiar
with your working environment and friends.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Continuity-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc10">3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuity</H3><!--SEC END -->

A developer should be prepared to work on the projects s/he is dealing
with continiously. Here ``continuity'' doesn't stand for a 7/24
work but it stresses the continuity of the subject to be dealt. For
different areas are clannish in an operation system, developers should
keep up with each others speed. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Accuracy-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc11">3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy</H3><!--SEC END -->

In the project you might be working on the same subject with more
than one developer. What's more, there might be other developers affected
by your work. For this reason not only the continuity of your work
but also the accuracy are of great importance in proportion with the
extend they affect other developers. If you are performing your work
on one of the main development repositories, you should take into
account the other developers working with you that are affected by
your work, in all stages. You should make sure that any change you
make does not -even slightly- prevent other developers from doing
their job.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Determination-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc12">3.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination</H3><!--SEC END -->

If you have the power of decision for a subject you are working on,
changing your decisions too often makes it difficult for the other
developers to follow and what's more important it makes the developers
who are dependent on you to have difficulties while working. Hence
it will be useful to take well-thought decisions and to ask for the
opinions of the other developers before making a decision.<BR>
<BR>
At a particular point if you feel that you should change your decision
anyway, you can do this by letting the other developers know about
it and -if your previous works are already being used- by working
in an ``experimental'' area harmless to them.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Communication-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc13">3.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication</H3><!--SEC END -->

It'll be useful to let other developers know about the decisions you
make, the steps you take and the changes -even the minor ones- you
make. In this way, you can adapt new developers -who are always needed-
to the subject you are dealing with easier, you can cooperate with
the developers you work with more consistently and faster. When you'll
be in need for help in the future, with the help of this attitude,
you can be sure that a solution will be produced faster because another
develepor already knows what you want to do. For communication you
can use e-mail lists, the documents you'll prepare or explanatory
information (such as subversion messages) you'll add to the changes
you make.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section New developer application-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc14">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;New developer application</H2><!--SEC END -->

There's always room for a new developer. You too can apply to be a
Pardus developer and become an official developer as well. Although
it's a prerequisite to accept the responsibility of being a new developer,
it's not enough for all cases. On the other hand, we can put it openly
that we are enthusiastic for delegation of responsibility and accepting
new developers. For details please keep on reading...<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Who may submit?-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc15">4.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who may submit?</H3><!--SEC END -->

Everyone who is working for Pardus and who accepts the developer responsibilities
described in this document may submit a <EM>new developer application</EM>.
The main channel of communication is the e-mail lists. In order to
accept an application, applicant's determination and style of working
should be obverved. In this sense, you can select a task suitable
for you and begin working on it before you submit. By sharing your
work with the other developers you enable them to examine your work
and so other developers will have the chance to become acquainted
with you. <BR>
<BR>
For example, it may be a good starting point to work on the software
which is already in the package repositories, propose new patches
and solutions, examine and test other solution proposals and report
what you get.<BR>
<BR>
Besides, there's a volunteering dashboard called Imece (which stands for an old way of collaboration in Turkey) <SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP> <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection How to submit?-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc16">4.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to submit?</H3><!--SEC END -->

To submit the application you can e-mail to admins@pardus.org.tr<BR>
<BR>
In your application e-mail;
<OL type=1><LI>
the development subjects you are working on related with Pardus,
<LI>other subjects you want to work on,
<LI>the e-mail address/username which you use for the bug tracking system,
<LI>your areas of specialization,
<LI>a Pardus developer who knows about your work and might be a reference
for you
</OL>
should be included.<BR>
<BR>
You should include the username and ciphertext (created by htpasswd)
of your password in your application e-mail. By doing so, you provide
us with the ciphertext of your password where you are the only one
who knows the plaintext. We can then add your username and password
wherever an identitiy check is required. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection to create a password with htpasswd-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc17">4.2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a password with htpasswd</H4><!--SEC END -->

You can create your password and username by using htpasswd program
and you can attach the output file to your e-mail. To do this, you
can use the command below:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
$&nbsp;htpasswd&nbsp;-c&nbsp;password_file&nbsp;user_name<BR>
<BR>
New&nbsp;password:<BR>
<BR>
Re-type&nbsp;new&nbsp;password:<BR>
<BR>
Adding&nbsp;password&nbsp;for&nbsp;user&nbsp;user_name
</TT></DL></DIV>
As a result an output file (password_file) will be created and you
can attach it to your e-mail.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection to create a password with perl-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc18">4.2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a password with perl</H4><!--SEC END -->

To do this the, you can use the command below:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
perl&nbsp;-e&nbsp;"print&nbsp;crypt('yourpassword','xy'),&#92;"&#92;n&#92;";"</TT><SUP><A NAME="text2" HREF="#note2"><TT>2</TT></A></SUP><TT>
</TT></DL></DIV>
This command will create just your password. In your e-mail you should
mention the username you want to use.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection to create a password with python-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc19">4.2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a password with python</H4><!--SEC END -->

You can do the same with python by using the command below:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
python&nbsp;-c&nbsp;"import&nbsp;crypt;&nbsp;print&nbsp;crypt.crypt('password',&nbsp;'xy')"
</TT></DL></DIV>
In this case as well, just the shadowed form of your password will
be given as output. In your e-mail you should mention the username
you want to use.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Subversion repositories-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc20">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Subversion repositories</H2><!--SEC END -->

The development process in Pardus is maintained via a Subversion version
control system. Subversion is an open source version tracking system.
Its a development infrastructure which makes it possible for more
than one application developer to work together unconcerned about
demolishing each others' changes. Thanks to this, any single software's
development process can be tracked backwards, the changes made gradually
can be watched and can be easily returned to any version of a particular
time.<BR>
<BR>
At the moment there are two subversion repositories we use in Pardus
structure .<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Pardus Repository-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc21">5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardus Repository</H3><!--SEC END -->

Pardus repository is the one in which the products being developed
within the project are kept. All the software developed for Pardus
is kept in Pardus repository. The repository is at the address https://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus.
It keeps the source package repositories where the software's PiSi
packages are found.<BR>
<BR>
More information on the Pardus repository can be found in the document
Pardus Depo Politikası (Pardus Repository Policy).<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Hierarchy of repository directories-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc22">5.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hierarchy of repository directories</H3><!--SEC END -->

Each Pardus subversion repository has the hierarchy of directories
detailed below.<BR>
<BR>
There are three main directories in a repository: trunk, tags and
repos.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection trunk/-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc23">5.2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;trunk/</H4><!--SEC END -->

Trunk is the directory in which continuous work is performed.<BR>
<BR>
Each project module (document, Web pages, software projects, etc.)
has its own directory under trunk/.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsubsection tags/-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc24">5.2.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;tags/</H4><!--SEC END -->

Tags directory is the place where, for any module, the work done under
trunk is tagged and copied to. Within this directory, there exist
3 directories.
<UL><LI>
<B>tags/RELEASE/</B>: This is the directory which software (or modules)
use to tag their own version numbers. For example, version 0.2 of
tasma is tagged in tags/RELEASE/tasma-0.2 directory.
<LI><B>tags/BLACKHOLE</B>/: Its a blackhole the projects for which the
development is stopped (because of the lack of a developer to deal
with it or no more need for that project) are ``thrown'' into.
When the projects in it are desired to be used again, they are copied
under trunk/ and worked on.
<LI><B>tags/RESTRUCTURED/</B>: Its the directory in which the module
is put if the software (or module) undergoes a total restructuring
and if the old files will not be used anymore. For example, ``abc''
project which was restarted to be written on 28th May 2005 is moved
under tags/RESTRUCTURED/abc-2005-05-28/.
</UL>
<!--TOC subsubsection repos/-->

<H4><A NAME="htoc25">5.2.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;repos/</H4><!--SEC END -->

Repos is a directory in which developers can advance their work in
an experimental nature without disturbing the other developers working
on the same module under trunk. The developer can proceed her/his
experimental work by creating her/his own directory under repos/.<BR>
<BR>
(As a rule which is valid only for packeges repository, the documents
related with this project are found under repos/doc directory.)<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Using Subversion-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc26">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Subversion</H2><!--SEC END -->

A very detailed user's manual<SUP><A NAME="text3" HREF="#note3">3</A></SUP> is available. Besides that book, information about the project can
be reached from the frequently asked questions page<SUP><A NAME="text4" HREF="#note4">4</A></SUP> on the own Web site<SUP><A NAME="text5" HREF="#note5">5</A></SUP> of Subversion project. In this section frequently needed commands
for practical usage are tried to be told by examples.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection How do I know if I have Subversion in my system or not?-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc27">6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I know if I have Subversion in my system or not?</H3><!--SEC END -->

As the quickest way to see if you have Subversion in your system or
not, you can refere to the output of ``svn --version'' command.
It's a good sign if you see something like this:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>

<!--TOC subsection What is a repository?-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc28">6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a repository?</H3><!--SEC END -->

A repository is a disk area on which the last version, all the versions
prior to the last version and the changes between versions of the
software package(s) every developer works on, information including
their user, date and cause are stored which can be reached by several
methods. <BR>

<!--TOC subsection How can I see what directories exist in a repository?-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc29">6.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I see what directories exist in a repository?</H3><!--SEC END -->

A single repository may contain more than one directory in it. The
hierarchy of a repository is just like the inside of a directory on
a disk. So, you can browse without having to copy all the repository
to your disk and just get a view of the part you want to work on or
have a look at. The list of directories and files in a repository
is displayed using ``svn ls repository_address'' format:

You have to update the copy of the repository you have periodically
with ``svn update'' command in order to know about the last changes
and to track the last version. If you call the command alone the files
in the directory you are on and the entire directory will be updated.
Besides, you can add the address of the directory or the single file
you want to update to the end of the command.

While you are working with SVN and during processes such as updating
and searching, as in the previous example, the signs by the files
are to inform you about what kind of a change related with the next
file is performed.<BR>
<BR>
One of the letters U, D, A, C or G may be found by files: 
<UL><LI>
<B>A</B> Added
<LI><B>D</B> Deleted
<LI><B>U</B> Updated
<LI><B>G</B> Merged (the last update you got from the repository is
merged with the file you are performing local changes)

You can use ``svn status'' command whenever you want to see what
changes you made in your copy. This command can run with an URI you
add to the end of it as all the other commands. Below its seen that
a file is added to, a file is deleted from and two files are changed
regarding the last updated copy of the repository:

While you are working on the copy of the repository when you would
like to create a new file, you should inform your local copy about
your intention to add that file to the repository with the help of
``svn add'' (it has sister commands such as ``svn copy'',
``svn del'' as well). Let's explain why there's such a need as
follows: Let's assume that you would like to compile and test an application
which is in your local copy. In this case, some files that you don't
prefer to send to the main repository will be created in your work
copy such as Makefiles and *.m4 files which only you have any need
for. In such cases, it will be very advantageous and convenient if
the files added locally are not added to the repository as well, because
when you change the source code of the software, recompile it and
decide to send it to the repository at a proper time, you know that
the other files are not going to the repository. With ``svn add'',
you add to the repository <EM>the files you want to add</EM>. ``svn
del'' will not mentioned again.

If you are sure of the last condition of the files you changed, you
can use ``svn commit'' command in order to transmit your changes
to the repository. By using this command -as its true for all the
rest- you can send to the repository a single file, a single directory
and what is under it or all the changes you made. When you run ``svn
commit'', svn -using your preferred text editor- opens a file for
you with the changes you made listed in it in order to make sure others
see what you changed and to enable your changes to be logged for backward
tracking in the repository. To alter the text editor opened as the
preferred one you can make use of the environment variable that svn
uses named SVN_EDITOR:
<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
&#126;/work/[...]/COMARd/csl/sample&nbsp;$&nbsp;SVN_EDITOR="vi"&nbsp;svn&nbsp;commit&nbsp;<BR>

<BR>
.<BR>
<BR>
.
</TT></DL></DIV>
As soon as you write the changes to the text editor, save what you
wrote and close the editor, svn will begin to send the changes in
your local copy to the repository.<BR>

Subversion repository is a common place shared by all developers.
In order to work together developers should be using the repository
efficiently, properly and in an organized way.<BR>
<BR>
Rules for using Subversion are the rules to be respected by the developers
having the privilege to write to Pardus repositories.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Always work with an updated repository-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc39">7.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Always work with an updated repository</H3><!--SEC END -->

The updates on the Subversion repository will be more frequent as
the quantity of the developers increase. In order to know about the
rest of the process and to avoid a conflict between what you do and
the rest to be done, before you begin to work, always update your
repository by means of <EM>svn update</EM> command.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Think before you commit-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc40">7.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Think before you commit</H3><!--SEC END -->

Think twice before you commit<SUP><A NAME="text6" HREF="#note6">6</A></SUP> the changes you made to the Subversion repository. The data you commit
to the repository will reach to all developers and affect their work.
In this sense, its of great importance to follow the articles below.
<OL type=1><LI>
Do not commit a non-running code to the Subversion repository.
<LI>Always update your repository before you commit by means of <EM>svn
update</EM> in order to get the last changes. Be sure that the changes
you made do not conflict with the others.
<LI>Pay attention to what you commit. To make sure of this, always control
the changes you are about to commit by means of <EM>svn diff</EM> command
before commitment.
<LI>Always test the changes you made. Even better, test them twice.
</OL>
<!--TOC subsection Add descriptive messages to your commitments-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc41">7.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Add descriptive messages to your commitments</H3><!--SEC END -->

Explanation messages used in the commitments should focus on the change
that is made and they should be as descriptive as possible. As much
as you can, try to add explanation messages related with only the
files you made changes on. However, in the limits of the context,
you can include all the information which can not be derived from
the output of a svn diff command in your explanation message.<BR>
<BR>
Refraining from adding a proper explanation message will make it difficult
to understand the changes you made.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Abide by the work plans-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc42">7.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abide by the work plans</H3><!--SEC END -->

If a work/time plan exists for the distribution in general or if the
main developer of the component you are working on sets such a plan,
abide by this plan regarding your commitments.<BR>
<BR>
For example, an application developer might want to stop adding new
features to the application at a particular time and might want to
work on fixing the known issues. Its expected that the change you
make is coherent with this rule.<BR>
<BR>
If you are not sure of the coherency of the change you made with the
plan, you have to refer the related e-mail lists or the main developer.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection If you made a change affecting more than one component, inform all
developers about the change.-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc43">7.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you made a change affecting more than one component, inform all
developers about the change.</H3><!--SEC END -->

In order to ensure all developers know about the ``major'' update
you made, always send an informative message to the related e-mail
list.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Take the responsibility of the change you made-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc44">7.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the responsibility of the change you made</H3><!--SEC END -->

If the update you made is creating a problem, take the responsibility
of it and make sure to solve it yourself or by getting help.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Respect the generally accepted principles-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc45">7.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect the generally accepted principles</H3><!--SEC END -->

Obey the general rules accepted during developers' discussions and
be sure that your changes are not violating those rules. In any case
you are unsure you can always choose the ``communication'' path.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Enter the bug number when solving a bug in the bug tracking system.-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc46">7.8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the bug number when solving a bug in the bug tracking system.</H3><!--SEC END -->

If the update you make is solving a reported bug, in order to synchronize
the bug tracking system with the updates in the repository, notify
the bug you solved and close the bug in the bug tracking system afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Update the files which you are responsible-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc47">7.9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Update the files which you are responsible</H3><!--SEC END -->

Update only the files which are in your responsibility. If you find
a bug in files which is in another developer's responsibility, first,
discuss the situation either by directly contacting the responsible
developer or by asking the other developers in e-mail lists and only
after doing so make an attemp to update the repository. If the responsible
developer does not accept the changes you made, behave respectfully.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Do not add the automatically created files to the repository-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc48">7.10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not add the automatically created files to the repository</H3><!--SEC END -->

Do not add the files such as Makefile, Makefile.in, configure scripts,
etc. which are created afterwards by compilation tools. These files
will be recreated in different forms in all developers' machines and
will be perceived as an update by the other develepors. In general,
adding these files to the repository is perceived as a bug.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Perform atomic updates-->

<H3><A NAME="htoc49">7.11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform atomic updates</H3><!--SEC END -->

Commit all the changes related with a particular improvement/update
at once. Subversion lets you commit more than one file at once. Other
developers might be confused because of seperate commits and they
can miss the improvements you made.<BR>
