		<span class="baslik"><a name="uludag_projesi" href="./sss.html#top"><i>What is Pardus Project?</i></a></span>
		<br><br>
Pardus was started and still developed by <a href = "http://www.uekae.tubitak.gov.tr/"> TÜBİTAK - UEKAE</a>. This project aims to develop a GNU/Linux, plans on answering the expectations and basic desktop requirements of the people who has informatics literacy by using excellent ways of Linux distributions, code or architecture with building tools that will make easy to use and setup operations.
        <br><br>
        The first version, Pardus 1.0, has been released on December, 27, 2006. The release notes for 1.0 can be found <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/release_notes1_0.html>here</a>.
		<br><br> 
	
		<span class="baslik"><a name="uludag_hedefleri" href="./sss.html#top"><i>What is the aim of Pardus Project?</i></a></span>
		<br><br>
		The aims of project are
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>to develop a widely-used distribution
		<li>to form an organization that will continue this distribution.
		<li>to contribute the original technology by creating a ecosystem using this distribution and open source software around it.
		</ul>
			    

		<br> 
	
	
		<span class="baslik"><a name="pardus" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Where the name "Pardus" comes from? Why is the name of distribution different from the name of project?</i></a></span>
		<br><br>
		The name "Pardus" comes from Anatolian Leopard, Panthera Pardus Tulliana.<br><br>
		Anatolian Leopard is one of the last members of Leopard subspecies. Anatolian Leopard's length reaches up to 200-250 cm, females are 35-50 kg and males 45-70 kg in weight. Their lifetime is about 20 years. Strong and agile Anatolian Leopard feeds on wild ungulates, chamois, deer, boar and birds. Anadolu Leopards lived in forest and hill regions of Aegean,West Mediterranean, East Mediterranean and East Anatolia.
Scarcity of hunting resources directed them to settling areas, because of this they were usually killed.<br><br>
		The last official record about Anatolian Leopard was in 1974-1-17. This record was about killing a Anatolian Leopard because of Leopard's  attack to a woman Bağözü Village, 5 km far from Beypazarı. Most of the views are about to die out, but it is suggested that there is still 10-15 Anatolian Leopard in Turkey. In 2001, around Dandi region in East Mediterranean, around Müsikli Brook in East Blacksea; in 2004, in Pokut Plateau in East Blacksea region, it has been seen. Volunteers' works still continues to prove assets of Anatolian Leopards and to protect them.<br><br>
		Pardus is the both the name of the project and our flagship Linux distribution.<br><br>


		<a name="linux" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Why Linux? Why don't you build all from scratch?</i></a><br><br>

Both Linux kernel and the applications we use like Firefox Web Browser, OpenOffice.org, KDE, etc ... are free software and they have been developed after a long time by lots of people. Doing this work doesn't provide us more than spending money and time.
<br><br>

Because of said software being free, when we need to develop something about Turkish support or do cleaning for last-users, we can do it easily by editing the software. Submitting these software again to free software world makes us having a voice in free software eco-system and directing this eco-system to takes advantages.
<br><br>
Linux has been springboard for us to catch and to pass IT World's current level by putting original contributions on it.
<br><br>

<a name="gelistiriciler" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Who develops this project? Is it a voluntary work?</i></a><br><br>

Pardus Project is being developed by Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Assocation (TÜBİTAK) - National Electronic and Cryptology Research Institute (UEKAE). All of the members of Pardus Project are employees of TÜBİTAK. Nonetheless, volunteers, with an increasing count, help with different parts of project.
We plan that the number of contributors will increase and they will have a voice in project so a new distribution will be formed by them around the TÜBİTAK's employees.<br><br>
		
<a name="son" href="./sss.html#top"><i>How long will this project continue? What if TÜBİTAK leaves supporting?</i></a><br><br>
		
Pardus Project will continue until the aims, forming a free software ecosystem and forming a organization to continue project, are completed. TÜBİTAK will support all work in accordance with these aims.<br><br>

If TÜBİTAK decides, surprisingly, not to support Pardus Project, Pardus will continue as a free software. Anyone or any company can continue to develop Pardus. TÜBİTAK has rights for only PARDUS brand. The software owners are whoever uses it.<br><br>

<a name="ziyaret" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Where is Pardus developed? What should I do if I want to meet you?</i></a><br><br>

UEKAE is in TÜBİTAK Gebze Campus, Kocaeli, Turkey where Pardus Project team also works. Due to UEKAE's security checks, you have to ask an appointment beforehand for a meeting.<br><br><br>

		<span class="baslik"><img src="./images/bullet-krm.png"> Using Pardus</span><br><br>
	
		<a name="indir" href="./sss.html#top"><i>How can I download Pardus?</i></a><br><br>

Use the following link to download Pardus: <a href="ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/kurulan">ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/kurulan</a>
<br><br>
After downloading the file, please check md5sum as told <a name="md5sum" href="./sss.html#md5sum">here</a> to be sure that you downloaded a non-corrupt file.
<br>
Alternatively, you can try Pardus Live CD without installing it to your hard disk. Pardus Live CD can be obtained from <a href=ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/calisan>here</a>.
<br><br>
			<a name="calisan_cd" href="./sss.html#top"><i>What is Pardus Live CD?</i></a><br><br>

Pardus Live CD is a product of Pardus Project that contains Linux kernel, software that most of them are free and developed by Pardus team. It fully works on CD and doesn't need to be installed to hard drive. Pardus Live CD has been developed to test Pardus Linux without installing to hard drive. You can use Pardus without damaging the other operating systems installed to your hard drive. You should only set BIOS to boot from CD.
<br><br>
For more information about Pardus Live Cd and usage, visit <a href="urunler/index.html">products</a> page.
<br><br>
		
		<a name="md5sum" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Some files on your web page have .md5sum extension. What is it?</i></a><br><br>

MD5SUM files are used to control whether if the downloaded ISO files are damaged while downloading. When you open MD5SUM files with an editor, you will see a string and a file name. You can check the MD5SUM of ISO file with <a href="ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/md5summer.exe">md5summer.exe</a> application. If the result of MD5SUM of ISO file and the string in the MD5SUM file aren't the same, it means ISO file was damaged while downloading. In that you have to download the ISO file again. Linux users can do this with "md5sum" application. In console, use "md5sum -c file_name.md5sum" command to check if the ISO file was damaged or not.
<br><br>
		
		<a name="cd_yazimi" href="./sss.html#top"><i>What should I attend to while writing Pardus to CD?</i></a><br><br>

If there is no problem with md5 summary, you can write ISO files to CD. ISO is a file system type for CDs so you shouldn't extract it with archive managers or copy the ISO file to CD. Otherwise, you won't have a bootable CD and be able to start installing Pardus. You should follow the instructions in help menu of the application , you use to write CD, to write ISO images (generally, specified as "writing an ISO image" or "creating a bootable cd").
<br><br>
		
		<a name="kurumsal" href="./sss.html#top"><i>I want to use Pardus in my corporation. Do you give corporate support?</i></a><br><br>

Pardus Project doesn't have a infrastructure to give support. So, we are planning to solve this through business partners. In this case, corporate support may be given as a new project in UEKAE or from a structure which base is UEKAE.
Business model its channels hasn't been formed yet so you won't be able to find ready solutions. But if you contact to <a href="mailto:info%20at%20pardus.org.tr">info at pardus.org.tr</a> to be a business partner, we can form a new project together.
 <br><br> 
		<a name="macinthos" href="./sss.html#top"><i>Can I use Pardus on my Macintosh?</i></a><br><br>

Pardus was prepared and compiled for Intel and Intel-compatible processors. We don't have a plan for making a version for PowerPC processor, used in Macintosh computers.

		Certainly no :) Ones that don't know programming can help as the ones that know programming.<br><br>
		
		<a name="yardim_2" href="./sss.html#top"><i>I want to help. Where is the information about help?</i></a><br><br>

In order to apply for a developer account, please read <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/belgeler/developer/new_developer.html>New Developer's Guide</a>
first. This documentation explains how contributors can support the project and the requirements to be a Pardus developer.  

<br>

Moreover, you can always install Pardus to your friends's machines and tell them how Pardus suits end users' needs. Join our mailing lists, observe what happens around and follow discussions. Without having a great knowledge, you can always use <a href=http://bugs.pardus.org.tr>Uluzilla</a>, the bug
repot system for Pardus, in order to foster the development of a quality-driven Linux distribution.

		<a name="program" href="./sss.html#top"><i>I wrote an application. Can you add it to Pardus?
</i></a><br><br>

There are some criteria to add an application to Pardus. First of all, it must be distributed under a free license and source codes must be accessed by public. It must call upon the <a href="./belgeler/okuryazar/okuryazar.html"> users who have informatics literacy </a>, be easy-to-use, be stable and the most important one; it must not be an alternative for the applications in Pardus (for example; a file manager instead of Konqueror won't be added to Pardus).

You can use Uluzilla to ask the developers to add the software that obtains the criteria above.
