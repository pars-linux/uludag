Introduction
*************

In this document we'll try to explain the requirements to be a Pardus developer/contributor. Although we are talking about Pardus in particular, the cited requirements in this document should apply to nearly all open source projects.

Please feel free to browse the web pages of `Pardus <http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng>`_ for other information not included in this document.

Who is a developer?
====================

To put it roughly, it is not wrong to say that the project should fulfill two types of mission. As it is the case for any distribution, gathering the software and preparing the infrastructure to enable this task and sustaining it, as well as developing new tools and technologies to form the soul of the distribution are among the required tasks.

When referring to developer, we describe not only those who write programs but also those who fulfill any single task. We are aware that work has to be done in many areas such as documentation, bug triaging, visual materials, translations etc. besides programming to implement a software project. We need all of them for Pardus as well.

How do I start?
================

First of all it's a good idea to keep up with the ongoing discussions. The most effective way of achieving this is to observe for a while and see how people work. It might be useful to join the `e-mail lists <http://lists.pardus.org.tr>`_ and follow the discussions, the ongoing events, the bug reports, the solutions proposed to the bug reports and examine the documents published.

By considering the outlined methods you may continue to help the development process. You can add your comments and proposals for solutions to the `bug reports <http://bugs.pardus.org.tr>`_ by testing the sofware or you can report the new bugs you've just found. You can contribute to develop innovative technologies and add new features or you can support a step of the process which you think is not working correctly or fast enough.

During the development process, you should always be in *communication* with other developers and contributors. As it's true for all tasks performed by more than one person, we always need to have knowledge of each other.

The process of development is completely transparent to the public, and open to any contributor who demonstrates the necessary skills and commitment to the project.

Communication
==============

Email discussion among Pardus developers takes place on the `pardus-devel mailing list <http://liste.pardus.org.tr/mailman/listinfo/pardus-devel>`_, which is moderated (except Pardus developers having an SVN account).

The ``#pardus-devel`` channel on FreeNode IRC network is home to many Pardus developers for real-time communication.
