KDE3 based live CD (calisan) is the successor of the Pardus stable live CD family, while KDE4 based one is intended as a preview about KDE4's status in Pardus.

With 2008.1, Pardus introduces Swedish support and Pardus' number of supported languages reaches 11 - thanks to our developer and translator communities. Starting with this release, Pardus will be offered as two variants to support this ever-increasing number of languages : one install CD with Turkish and English support only (and a selection of additional development tools and games), and an internationalized install CD with support for all 11 languages. As always, users can install and use additional language support packages from Pardus' repositories, regardless of which install CD they've used to install their systems.
