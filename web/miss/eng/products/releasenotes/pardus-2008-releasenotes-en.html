related to Pardus. We would like to thank our users and developers with their 
bug reports, related fixes, new package or feature suggestions for this release.

<h2>2. Basic features</h2>

This section describes the Pardus 2008 features.

<h3>2.1 User authorization management</h3>

The privileges of all users may be arranged and the password inquiry behavior may easily be customized by using the advanced user authorization system of Pardus 2008. The new and improved User Manager, on the other hand, makes authorization management very easy and secure.

The authorization system and privilege management interfaces, which have been developed by Pardus developers, make use of Pulaski - dbus infrastructure and work in conjunction with COMAR to provide system-wide and hassle-free authorization control infrastructure.

<h3>2.2 Easy to use Network Manager</h3>

Network manager supports auto-detection of your wireless profiles and automatically switches to the detected profile. The connection information is viewable at the system tray, which is updated continuously and informs user via a popup which makes network manager more intuitive and user friendly. Ethernet, wireless and modem connections, together with all customized configuration, may be saved as profiles for different locations for easy connectivity.

<h3>2.3 Improved package management system</h3>

The package manager PiSi (Packages installed Successfully, as intended), which downloads and installs new packages in only a few clicks, have been improved and get faster in performance. The most recent versions of applications that you use are updated by downloading only the changed parts, which make download times much shorter.

Using the newly added support for history management in PiSi and new History Manager you may go back to the previous versions of packages, may have snapshots of your current state, and go back and forth between these snapshots.

<h3>2.4 YALI </h3>

The installer program YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer), first asks the questions necessary, then starts with installation, which takes around 30 minutes. Customization of user information, automatic login, timezone, system keyboard and language settings are done easily. It is possible to change all these configuration setting afterward, using configuration manager TASMA, as usual. 

In addition, YALI includes the new and improved partitioning interface , which makes managing hard disks a charm: It is possible to easily customize the installation and boot system. The fully rewritten automatic resizing and installation choices makes installation problem-free and fast.

One of the strong points of Pardus, fully automatic hardware detection, has become better in Pardus 2008. The printers attached to the systems are automatically detected and configured in Pardus 2008. Widely used peripheral devices such as wireless network devices, webcams, printers, scanners and all-in-ones are supported much better in Pardus 2008 for a problem-free operation.
