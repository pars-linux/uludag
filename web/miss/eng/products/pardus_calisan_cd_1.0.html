If summaries are not same, this means that the file in your computer
was damaged because of a connection problem during the ISO file's
downloading process. Then you shouldn't write the damaged ISO file to

shouldn't open it with archive tools or you shouldn't copy it into a
CD. Otherwise your CD will not be a bootable disc and Pardus can not
start. Please find that how to an ISO file can be written, from your

                  <span class="baslik">Before
To Start Working With Pardus</span> <br>
                  <br>
For opening your computer with Pardus, putting the Pardus Live CD to
your CD-ROM Drive and restarting the computer is sufficent. <br>
                  <br>
At this time if your computer starts with operating system which was on
your hard disc, normally this shows that you can't set your BIOS or you
can't write the CD correctly. <br>
                  <br>
At this situation you should set your BIOS for starting from CD-ROM
drive. For this in your mainboard's BIOS starting up settings, CD-ROM
drive must be chosen as first. On the other hand, laptop users may need
to select starting up devices via special key combinations which is
determined by producers. If you tried but couldn't prosper or if you
don't know how to do, you can get information from your mainboard's
manual. <br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="baslik">Starting
Pardus</span> <br>
                  <br>
After your computer begin starting up with Pardus in the CD-ROM drive,
you will see a manu which contains choices that you can move with
direction keys and select with enter key:<br>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pardus
Linux </li>
                    <li>Pardus
Linux (HT or minimum 2 CPU systems) </li>
                    <li>Pardus
Linux (minimum settings [vesa=standart]) </li>
                    <li>Pardus
Linux (minimum settings [acpi=off, apm=off, vesa=standart]) </li>
                  </ul>
First choice is default and probably suitable for you. Second choice is
which have more than one cpu. Third or fourth choices are for old
computers or laptops which may have some problems and for some desktop
systems. When you select one of these choices, Linux Kernel begin to be
loaded to your memory. After a while you will see a progress bar, which
shows that how much part of process have done, with green coloured
Pardus screen. If your monitor gets dark and there is no signal for a
long time, you should restart your computer with RESET button and
choose 3rd or 4th choices from the menu. Although you try all choices,
your computer can not be started up with Pardus because of hardware
problems.<br>
                  <br>
At the last part of starting, green coloured Pardus screen shuts down
and desktop environment begin to start up. At this time if your screen
gets dark or if you see "Signal Out Of Range" message, you can decrease
the default resolution with CTRL, ALT and - key combination. After your
graffical environment was started up, you can set the screen resolution
again with configuration manager which is at the rigth bottom of the
screen.<br>
                  <br>
Later, desktop environment's starting up screen will appear and finally
desktop will completely start up. <br>
