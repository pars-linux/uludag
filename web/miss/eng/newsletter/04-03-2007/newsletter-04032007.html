Welcome to the third issue of Pardus newsletter, which is
also available in other languages. Here, we aim to provide our community
with up to date information about the development of the Pardus Linux
distribution, the ongoing discussions on various forums, as well as news
submissions by the users and developers from around the world.

<p>

In this issue, we cover the latest batch of updates in the official Pardus
repositories, the new Pardus 2007.1 maintenance release, 
great Pardus reviews in media, a new project member and much more.

<p>

Have fun reading.


<p>


<p><span class="baslik">Pardus 2007.1 Felis chaus is out</span><p>

Focusing on the new release,
namely 2007.1, developers only had one aim: rendering Pardus as easy and seamless
as possible. With Pardus 2007.1 we are now closer to our shared vision, to
make an intuitive desktop experience for newcomers. Pardus 2007.1 even
closes the gap a bit more towards an ultimate Linux distribution with
next KDE version 3.5.6, a new language 
<a href=http://pedroonpardus.blogspot.com/2007/02/brazilian-portuguese-flavor.html>(Brazilian Portuguese)</a>, many
security fixes and enhancements. This version provides a better 
network management experience with WPA authentication, status monitoring and speed improvements. Moreover,
PISI (Pardus package manager) is now 40% faster with repository processes.

<p>

Pardus 2007.1 Felis chaus introduced one new language, however Pardus developers are working on 
<a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/translation/stats/>more languages (i.e Italian and French)</a>
to appear in the next version, 2007.2.

<p>

Pardus 2007.1 ISO file can be immediately downloaded from <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/download.html>Pardus servers or mirror addresses</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">Reviews</span><p>

More Pardus reviews pop up from news
sites. This time, Pardus 2007 was reviewed by <a
href=http://www.quebecos.com/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&artid=54>Quebecos.com</a> (in French),
with very positive thoughts. Another review from <a
href=http://beranger.org/index.php?fullarticle=2623>Beranger comes</a>,
stating <i>"Pardus 2007.1 deserves much more attention than PCLinuxOS 2007 or Kubuntu"</i>. After the introduction
of Pardus 2007.1 for the masses, we'll probably see more enthusiastic reviews from Pardus lovers. Keep up the good work, developers!

<p><span class="baslik">Pardus 2007 updates</span><p>

Pardus 2007 users still benefit from systematic updates, regularly distributed
from Pardus repositories. Lately, the update server has introduced some 
critical updates, as well as <a href=http://cekirdek.pardus.org.tr/~erdinc/zangetsu/blog/2007/02/25/123/>experimental 
and/or stable packages</a>

<p><span class="baslik">Pardus runs the university library lab</span><p>

<a href=http://www.comu.edu.tr/english/>Çanakkale 18 Mart University</a> has decided to go with Pardus
in its student laboratories. The result? More than 20 computers are running smoothly with Pardus,
using Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) packages. All the machines are diskless, 
meaning that the applications on them are stored on a remote server to lower maintanence cost 
and ease administration. We expect to see more and in-depth case 
studies from university labs and K12s featuring Pardus for the benefit of students. For a few
snapshots of the classroom, click <a href=http://cekirdek.pardus.org.tr/~erdinc/zangetsu/blog/2007/03/13/131/>here</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">Developer's Arena</span><p>

As you know, the popular development language Python is extensively used in each aspects of Pardus.
Pardus is built on Python, starting from init subsytem through installation, hardware configuration and
system management. Pardus developers have written a nice Python article, which shows 
how a matura Linux distribution can be developed using Python APIs. Read more 
<a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/comar/PythonInPardus.html>here</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">More Pardus art</span><p>

We now see more and 
more screenshots, splash screens and opening sounds for Pardus in <a href=http://www.kde-look.org>kde-look.org</a>. 
Just try yourself: Clicking <a href=http://www.kde-look.org>here</a> and typing "Pardus" in search bar will sufice!

<p>
Also, one of our Pardus lovers, Abdulkerim Aydın, provides us a nice set of 
<a href=http://h2okerim.deviantart.com/gallery/?order=9>Pardus screenshots</a>, showing how
nice, intuitive and productive a Pardus desktop can be. 
<p>
Thank you, Kerim!
