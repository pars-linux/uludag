            <_description>Looking for a production suite? Our suggestion is LibreOffice! LibreOffice gives a stable, fast and free office experience while all your software and documents will be compatible with the rest of major suites. As the roots of the LibreOffice lies in years long open source office experience, even the first stable release is much powerful and competetive with Writer for text documents, Calc for spreadsheets, Impress for presentations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pardus packs this great office suite with a number of enhancements and plug-ins for a better experience.</_description>

            <_description>KDE is the desktop choice of Pardus, a software collection for desktop use with hundreds, even thousands of programs targeting different purposes. For end-users and daily needs or the corporates with integrated, high performance yet easy-to-use solutions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Pardus&apos;s in-house tools are written KDE friendly as well, so it is strongly recommended. However, there are different alternatives such as Enlightenment or Xfce both suggest lightweight, faster yet less feature-rich desktop experience. </_description>

Or you can utilize any KDE application as they can work in Dolpin embedded. Thus you can edit an image file in your file manager with the full features of Gwenview, the image viewer or preview a video in the optional and customizable Information panel.</_description>
