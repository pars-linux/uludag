Package Manager TODO

* Integrate security advisories

  We have a security team that keeps track of the security problems the packages and write detailed
  informations about the problems as Pardus Linux Security Advisories. 
  
  http://security.pardus.org.tr
 
* Integrate update informations

  We push updates to the repository time to time. When they are pushed, we write a detailed report
  about the updates that are readable by non-developers (end-users). We have a mechanism in
  pspec.xml that holds a history field holding the release related informations. But most of the
  time the informations there, are for developers only like a summary of buffer overflow bug and 
  how it was fixed or a simple "version bumped" line that are surely not targeted for the end-users. 

  We decided to write and keep end-user targeted details of each Update Pack in a separate place. 
  So following are the reasons not to hold these informations in pspec.xml.

  - Comments in pspec.xml contains developer-to-developer information.

  - Translations are possible for Update Pack details. We decided pspec.xml is not the place 
    for keeping translation informations.

  - Pardus test repositories sometimes sees more than one release of a package. And when the package
    is pushed to stable repository, Update Pack detail of the package holds the summary of these 
    changes.
      
  It is not an easy job to write update details by one person. After deciding the xml format of update
  packs, we should write scripts to create most of the xml file easing the job of the writers.
