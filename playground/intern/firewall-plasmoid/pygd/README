Firewall plasmoid is an applet for Pardus Linux distrubiton using its COMAR
infrastructure and KDE's D-Bus. In the project, i aim to develop a simple, but
helpful tool for Pardus users. So, they will manage their firewall's (iptables)
simply via a plasmoid on their desktops. In its first version (0.0 version - 
July 5, 2010) it can only do starting and stopping tasks.
