- Check dhcp, tftp, ltspfs, perl-X11-Protocol and ptsp-server's pisi packages. If isnt installed, terminate script.

- Create a network profile and activate this. If already there is a profile for this, only activate the profile.

- Edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file. Select correct DHCPD_IFACE (network interface, e.g. eth0), edit this file carefully.

- Edit /etc/X11/kdm/kdmrc file. Using ConfigParser may make this step too easy. After that warn user to restart X server.

- Edit /etc/exports file.

- Edit /etc/hosts file. Ask how many users will use this system and add according to this.

- Modprobe fuse. It is automaticly loaded since Pardus 2009. So check release name before this step.

- Edit /opt/ptsp/etc/pulse/system.pa file. (Pulseaudio) Do this if user wants. (Ask user for this)

- Optimizing Firefox, disable caching pixmaps.

- Start dhcp, tftp, nfs-utils and portmap services.

- Edit /opt/ptsp/etc/pts-client.conf file to set server's ip address. (Use ConfigParser to set this.)Also change ip addresses in dhcpd.conf and system.pa files.
