This is a README file about Guest Account PAM module.

Now, this module give access to guest users. 

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

pam_python (http://ace-host.stuart.id.au/russell/files/pam_python/)

INSTALLATION:
------------

Copy guestlogin.py file to /lib/security. (Actually same directory with pam_python.so)

Edit files in /etc/pam.d/ directory.

For Example: Edit system-auth file for login.

Add this line after pam_env.so line:

auth    [user_unknown=ok]      pam_python.so guestlogin.py


After adding pam_python line to the file, file's first lines will be like that:

#%PAM-1.0

auth    required        pam_env.so
auth    [user_unknown=ok]      pam_python.so guestlogin.py
.
.
.


Important thing is file's syntax and sequence.

Sequence is like pam_env.so, pam_python.so, pam_unix.so.

Syntax is:

type control module-path module-arguments.

Our type is auth because we will use it for authentication.

control is [user_unknown=ok] because this file only triggered when user is unknown for authenticate guest account. For other users pam_unix.so will be triggered.

module-path is pam_python.so and argument is out login file, guestlogin.py.

Next login this module will be triggered and guest accounts can able to login without password or account.

USAGE:
------

For use, login as guest (case sensitive, all cases are downcase).

This module gives a home directory (in /home/) and a guest username (like guestX where X is an integer).

Have Fun!

TODO:
-----

After logout, user and user's home directory deletion.
Guest Privileges.(rw to /home/guestX etc.)
