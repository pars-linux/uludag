Relase Canditate
----------------

The term release candidate (RC) refers to a version with potential to be a
final product, ready to release unless fatal bugs emerge. At the start point
of this  stage all bugs are reviewed and marked as RC release blocker or
Final release brocker.

Release canditate is called code complete when the development team agrees
that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There may
still be source code changes to fix defects. There may still be changes
to documentation and data files, and to the code for test cases or utilities.
New code may be added in a future release.

Therefore, at the end of this stage all RC release blocker bugs should be fixed.

Final Release

has been delivered or provided to the users.
