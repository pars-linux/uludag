=========

 .. image:: images/bugcycle.png

This document gives information about Pardus bug tracking system process. The process that manage from Pardus bugzilla: package review, new contributor, security process are not included in this process.

    #. When the bug is newly submitted it takes "NEW" status.
        Some details needed when reporting a bug, see http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html

    #. After the bug is submitted, if it needs additional information , the bug status left the same but the "NEEDINFO" keyword is added.
    #. If the bug does not need any additional information:
        #. The triager can change the severity:
            - Severity is used to set how sewere the bug is. It can be set by a triager, but the triagers may not rechange the severity, when the assignee and/or package maintainer change the initial severity level chosen by the triager.
            - Severities should be changed with following guidance:
                - Urgent: the bug makes whole system unusable
                - High: the bug makes the program unusable
                - Normal: a real bug which makes program more difficult to use and a part of the program unusable.
                - Low: A cosmetic problem, such as a misspelled word or misaligned text or an enhancement.
                - New feature: new feature requests
        #. If the bug is an insoluable bug:
            - WONTFIX: Bugs are not related to Pardus and will never be fixed
            - DUPLICATE: Bugs which have duplicates which are already been reported
            - LATER: Bugs can be fixed for the next release or for a later time
            - INVALID: Bugs that are not realy a bug
            - WORKSFORME: Bugs could not be reproduced
            - NEXTRELEASE: Bugs fixed in next release

        #. Bugs set as a tracker bug of a release only by release managers or related component supervisor.

    #. If the bug is fixed by its developer,

        When the developer has been sure that the bug is fixed, he/she should be fixed bug via SVN commits:

          The SVN commit should include "BUG:FIXED:<BUGID>"

        This commmit will automatically change the resolution of the bug as "RESOLVED/FIXED"

    #. When the bug is fixed, program will pass the stable repository test process:
        #. If the bug reproducible, the bug resolution is changed to "REOPENED"
        #. If the bug can not be reproducible, it is left "RESOLVED/FIXED"
        #. If new bugs found during stable repository tests, it should be reported by testers.

    #.  "REOPENED" bugs are reviewed again by assignee and will be fixed.
