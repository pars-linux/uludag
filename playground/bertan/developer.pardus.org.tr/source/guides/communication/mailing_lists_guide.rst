Please first try to find `help documents`_ or look into `list archives`_ about your problem. If you do not find a suitable answer, you can write to a relevant list.

Posting
-------

#. Mail lists generally has a high traffic, thousands of copies are posted to many machines, so please:
    #. keep mail short
    #. do not add attachments
    #. do not `cross post`_

#. `Do not use HTML messages`_, because HTML messages:
    #. Can contain malicious contents
    #. Wastes bandwith
    #. Does not always work
    #. Renders slowly
    #. Are not suitable for digested lists

#. If you start a new topic, please create a new message, do not try to reply to an existed message.
#. Do not recycle messages. Recycling messages is replying to an existing thread by changing the thread name. This creates confusion and diverts the number of people replying to the topic.
#. Give good subject line. That helps you get help from the right people quickly.
#. Use `bottom or inline posting`_ and trim irrelevant parts. Your message will be more organized and readable.
#. Be polite in your messages. Never sevear or be rude to anyone.
#. If one of the mails is offended you personally, please send a private message about your displeasure, instead of sending it to the mailing list.
#. No gender or nationality is abuse is allowed on the lists.
#. Be careful when using sarcasm and humour. Without face to face communications your joke may be viewed as criticism. When being humourous, use emoticons (smileys) to express humour.
#. Do not send invitations or social networking connections through the mailing list.
#. Avoid commercial messages.
#. Avoid long signatures and disclaimers.
#. Do not use CAPITALS, this means shouting, instead you can use _something_.
#. Do not send same message many times. The other members of the list generally volunteers and can reply to your message in 24-48 hours.
