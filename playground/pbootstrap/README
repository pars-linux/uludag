pbootstrap
----------

pbootstrap is an utility to install a specific Pardus release into a
destination directory. Once mounted as rootfs, that destination directory
will be a fully functional Pardus installation.

Why it is needed?
-----------------

Currently YALI and pardusman have redundant code portions which achieve
this purpose but we need an utility like this to easily create an
LXC guest installation.
