* grub4dos record removal method using bcdedit safely

* solve gui freezing problem during installation.

* make initramfs to boot CD properly from nested folder other than device root.
  update kernel params, accordingly.

* Live CD or ISO detection feature for versions prior to Pardus 2011, prevent
  usage of those Install CDs or Install ISO files.

* grub4dos installer (grldr, menu.lst). copy files to the destinations.

* idea of renaming grldr as parldr (any better ideas in terms of 8.3 naming
  convention?)

* create pardus 2009 packages for paw-specific installations.

* test insalling with downloaded file

* WUBI of Ubuntu conflicts with PaW because of having same menu.lst in c:\.

* if there is a Pardus folder under installation root, do not allow proceed,
  first uninstall the program and then let the user continue. plan more on the
  scenario. we can warn the user at the beginning of the program if there is
  Pardus key in the appropriate registry path.

* split installer and uninstaller py files?
