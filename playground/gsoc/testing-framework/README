Pardus Testing Framework
------------------------

The aim of this project is to create a testing framework for Pardus which will interpret and execute XML-based test case files and then send the results back to the testing team, - all without minimum user intervention. 

There are two major components of this project:

1. Interpretation and execution of XML test case files.
2. Allowing the testing team to easily create the test case files.

The framework will be written in Python and lxml will be used for handling XML. For the GUI part, we will be using PyQt.
