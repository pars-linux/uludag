Beta Release 

Today marks the release of a fully working and stable beta version of the project. 
We had lots of fun working on developing and improving the software and hope you 
will enjoy as much using it. Coincidentally, today also happens to be the last 
working day of Google Summer of Code 2010. The summer passed so quickly!

You can try out the framework by checking it out from the SVN.

Here are some of the changes we made:

+	A graphical user interface in PyQt for the 'gui' and 'shell' tests
+	A script that allows you to create testcases easily and quickly!
+	Some parts of the report generation module were written again
+	Speed optimizations, thanks to lxml and the PiSi API
+	The 'automated' test has been improved

-	No more command line interface for 'gui' and 'shell' tests
	We decided to go ahead with a GUI for these two tests

As always, feel free to send in your suggestions, bugs and love!

A special thanks to Semen Cirit for all the patience she kept and her ideas which 
were instrumental in the development of this project. Thank you!
