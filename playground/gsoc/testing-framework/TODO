1.	Implement a GUI layer for the 'gui' testcase

	This should be pretty easy to since the CLI backend is ready and 
	we have only one testcase which requires a user interface. 


2.	Support for passing packages for custom parsing through the command line

	As of now, the framework provides support for custom package parsing
	through a file (the '-p' switch)
	
	We intend to replace the optparse module with argparse (2.7 standard library),
	that allows for variable arguments to be passed. 

	* Planned
	
	framework -f test_file.xml -p package-1 package-2 package-3 ... package-n
  
	* Current

	framework -f test_file.xml -p package_file		
	
	Where package_file is a file with the contents:
      
	package-1
	package-2	
	package-3
	.
	.
	package-n
