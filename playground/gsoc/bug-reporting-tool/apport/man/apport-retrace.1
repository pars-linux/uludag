.SH NAME

apport\-retrace \- regenerate a crash report's stack trace

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B apport\-retrace
[
.I OPTIONS
]
.I report

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B apport\-retrace
regenerates the stack traces (both the simple and the threaded one) in
an apport crash report from the included core dump. For this it
figures out the set of necessary packages and their accompanying debug
symbol packages, so that the regenerated stack trace will be fully
symbolic and thus become much more useful for developers to fix the
problem.

.B apport\-retrace 
attempts to install the missing packages. This requires root
privileges, but will work fine in a chroot with the fakeroot and
fakechroot libraries, so that the entire process can be performed with
just normal user privileges.

If this tool is run as normal user, then it will merely print out the
missing packages as a warning and continue the retracing process. It
will yield worse up to unusable results, though.

.I report
is either the path to a .crash file, or a bug number. In the latter
case, the information is downloaded from the bug report, and either
one of the options
.B \-g\fR,
.B \-s\fR, or
.B \-o\fR
have to be used to process the report locally, or 
.B \-\-auth
needs to be specified to attach the resulting stack traces back to the
bug report.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-c, \-\-remove\-core
Remove the core dump from the report after stack trace regeneration.
By default it is retained.

.TP
.B \-g, \-\-gdb
Start an interactive gdb session with the report's core dump.

.TP
.B \-s, \-\-stdout
Write the new stack traces to stdout instead of putting them back into
the report.

.TP
.B \-o \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-\-output=\fIFILE
Write modified report to given file instead of changing the original
report.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Report download/install progress when installing additional packages.

.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unpack\-only
Only unpack the additionally required packages, do not configure them.
The additional packages are purged again after retracing. This is
particularly useful when running this program in a fakeroot
environment, when not every package can be cleanly installed
completely.

.TP
.B \-p, \-\-extra\-package
Install an additional package for retracing. May be specified multiple
times.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a short online help that documents all options.

.TP
.B \-\-auth=\fIauthfile
If a bug number is given without any of the options
.B \-g\fR,
.B \-s\fR, or
.B \-o\fR,
then the retraced stack traces are attached to the bug.
Since this needs authentication, an authentication file for the crash
database must be specified. This could e. g. be the standard
.B cookies.txt
from Firefox' profile directory if the crash database uses
cookie based authentication.

.TP
.B \-\-confirm
Display retraced stack traces and ask for confirmation before
uploading them to the bug report. This option is ignored when
retracing report files.

.TP
.B \-\-duplicate\-db=\fIdbfile
Specify path to the duplicate check database (in SQLite format). The
database will be created and initialized if it does not exist. If not
specified,
.B apport\-retrace
will not check for duplicates.
