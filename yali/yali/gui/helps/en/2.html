<font size="+2">Partitioning your hard disk</font>

<p>
Pardus can be installed on a variety of hardware. You can install Pardus
on an empty disk or hard disk partition. An installation will automatically
destroy the previously saved information on selected partitions. 
</p>
<p>
In order to use Pardus, you must create one Linux filesystem (for the 
basic files and folders) and a swap space (for improved performance). 
We advise you to allocate at least 4 GBs of hard disk area and 
swap space (between 500 Mb - 2 GB, according to your needs) for 
convenience.

Please refer to Pardus Installing and Using Guide for more information
about disk partitioning.
