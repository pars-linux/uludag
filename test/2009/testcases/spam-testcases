    If your spam filter supports it, the GTUBE provides a test by which you
    can verify that the filter is installed correctly and is detecting incoming
    spam. You can send yourself a test mail containing the following string of
    characters (in upper case and with no white spaces and line breaks):

    XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X

    You should send this test mail from an account outside of your network.
