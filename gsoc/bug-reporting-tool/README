Instalation
-----------

Dependencies
============

 * distutils-extra: https://launchpad.net/python-distutils-extra

Steps
=====

Just issue *python setup.py install* on each python library directory
Note: In some cases, installing apport though setup.py may require passing the _--root /_ option.


Apport Configuration
--------------------

Set the default database options in /etc/apport/crashdb.conf. There should
already be a Pardus entry with dummy options.

The kernel must have core_pattern enabled so that /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
reads "|/usr/bin/apport %p %s %c".


Step-by-Step Testing Guide
--------------------------

Initial Setup
=============

To avoid installing every package, simply add every python library directory
to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

    cd /path/to/bug-reporting-tool/
    for d in "apport cookiepot pybugz"; do export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)${d}:${PYTHONPATH}; done
    # as root
    mkdir /var/crash
    chmod 777 /var/crash

Testing the BugTool wizard
==========================

    cd bugtool/src
    python temporal-generate.py && python bugtool.py

Testing the Apport Front-End
============================

NOTE: This test procedure is not working on Pardus2009 ATM. The process info
on /proc is getting deleted before apport is able to kick-in and grab the
needed information. Pardus2008 is working fine.

Since papport will be called by the system when there's a crash, the easiest
way to test it is installing via setup.py. The procedure bellow *won't* work
unless the PYTHONPATH is set accordingly for **every user** in the system
(i.e.: setting up /etc/profile, for example).

    ulimit -S -c unlimited # enable coredumps
    cd pardus-apport/src
    python temporal-generate.py && chmod a+x papport.py
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):${PYTHONPATH}
    # as root
    echo "|/usr/bin/apport %p %s %c" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
    # back to normal user
    bash -c 'kill -SEGV $$' # forcing a segfault to trigger apport
    # this should create a file in /var/crash named something like _bin_bash*
    /path/to/papport -c /var/crash/_bin_bash*
