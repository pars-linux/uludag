<h2>Speeding up Linux: One step further with Pardus</h2>

[girizgah buraya gelecek]

<p>

Distrowatch.com lists more than 400 distributions, most of which are
used for everyday lives at home. Similarly, most, if not all, of the
distros listed have been derived from other major distributions
such as <a href=http://www.slackware.org>Slackware</a>,
<a href=http://fedora.redhat.com>Fedora</a>, <a
href=http://www.opensuse.org>OpenSUSE</a> and such. This gives developers
a high degree of freedom and re-use of existing components, i.e a stable
base system, package repositories, a great multitude of patches and
security fixes. A recent study [1] has enabled for Linux newcomers to
have an idea about the roots of distributions.

<p>

While there's always a hot, ongoing debate about which package manager
to use, <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng>Pardus</a> developers have
chosen not to rely on any package managers and decided to roll a brand
new one. This may seem like a re-invention of the wheel, however one
of the core developers, Çağlar Onur, claims that a new approach to
build packages with PiSi gives extreme flexibility for packagers. The
new package manager, <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projeler/pisi>PiSi</a>
(<b>p</b>ackages </b>i</b>nstalled <b>s</b>uccessfully as <b>i</b>ntended)
is completely written in Python. While PiSi deserves a full article of
its own, we'll be focusing on a new approach Pardus presents, i.e a new
init framework called Mudur which primarily focuses on notoriously slow
and complex initialization system of Linux.

<p>

Before starting to dig into Mudur, let's investigate how other
technologies lead to a better init system. IBM has initially <a
href=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-boot.html>worked
on</a> a parallelization model which shows how to improve the boot speed
of a Linux system without compromising usability. The technique merely
involves parallelization of services during boot time and reduce startup
time of the whole system. Probably all readers interested in init systems
have an in-depth knowledge about <a href=http://www.initng.org>Initng</a>,
which dramatically decreases the boot up duration and already used by
some distributions. Initng is a full replacement of the old and in many
ways deprecated sysvinit tool. It is designed to significantly increase
the speed of booting a unix-compatible system by starting processes
asynchronously. Last but not least, another alternative depinit has been
driving attention for quite some time, with the ability to handle parallel
execution, dependencies, true roll-back, pipelines, improved signaling
and unmounting filesystems on shutdown. According to the developers,
it's somehow experimental and requires some time to incorporate an
existing system.

<p>

While Linux is blamed to boot slower for some time, the work ongoing listed
above will lead to faster boot times in conjuction with steady and consistent
advances in CPU speeds, cache improvements and dropping of hard disk seek
times. Believe it or not, this has been a serious issue in other operating systems 
like <a href=http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html>MacOS X</a> or 
MS Windows. For example, in Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger, Apple
introduced a new system startup program called launchd. The launchd daemon
takes over many tasks from cron, xinetd, mach_init, and init, which are UNIX
programs that traditionally have handled system initialization, called systems
scripts, run startup items, and generally prepared the system for the user
[6]. Likewise, Windows uses BootCache, Hot File Clustering and similar
techniques to boost performance.

<h2>What Mudur brings</h2>

Mudur has been developed for Pardus, so it's probably not available
for other distributions immediately. Since Mudur uses completely rewritten
service scripts, it needs a genuine modification of the files read after init 
is executed. In this manner, Mudur resembles that of initng and depinit.
Developers need to work hard in order to see Mudur, but it's worth the 
effort and time spent.
