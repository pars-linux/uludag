pisi 2.2.19 (??/02/2010)
-------------------------

Bug fixes
----------

6748   - pisi fails to install a package when CWD doesn't exist anymore (real fix)
9991   - blacklisted system.base packages are not ignored during update
11818  - Cosmetic: Remove 'minimal' from some UI messages,
12136  - Handle urllib2 errors of dummy .part files created as a result of unreachable
         translations.xml files.

Other improvements
-------------------

- Sanitize some error handlings during translations.xml parsing,
- Ignore source package translations if <Name> is empty in translations.xml,
- Don't wait until packaging for complaining about invalid version strings,
- Fix the behaviour of <AnyDependency> when the last dependency package is removed,
- Do not ignore parameter in perlmodules.make(). Tests of some Perl modules were not
  running at all before this fix,
- Allow comparing Version objects with strings,


New features
-------------

- Add support for reverse applying a patch with <Patch reverse="[tT]rue"> in pspec.xml,

- pisi --add-repo will now add, update and check the repository by default without
  asking if you want to update the index or not. If fetching the index from the given
  URL fails, pisi will remove the repository as before,

- 2 new options to pisi-cli --add-repo: --ignore-check and --no-fetch
    - If --ignore-check is given, pisi ignores the arch/distro check after a successful
    add/update phase,
    - --no-fetch is for not fetching the index. If this is given, pisi will be unable
    to check the arch and distro of the repository as it doesn't have access to the index

- components.xml now recognizes <Maintainer> tags,

- Add ability to use <AdditionalFiles> for <Source> packages,

- You can now define more than 1 <Archive>'s in pspec.xml files.


And translation updates..
