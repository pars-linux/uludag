Welcome to the second issue of the biweekly Pardus newsletter, which is
also available in Dutch and Turkish. Here, we aim to provide our community
with up to date information about the development of the Pardus Linux
distribution, the ongoing discussions on various forums, as well as news
submissions by the users and developers from around the world.

<p>

In this issue, we cover the latest batch of updates in the official Pardus
repositories, the new PardusWiki, various Pardus related news in media,
the Pardus map in Frappr as well as the special commemorative Pardus
coins by the Turkish Mint. Have fun reading.

<p>

<p><span class="baslik">Pardus in the news</span><p>

In the last two weeks, the recently released Pardus 2007 has continued
to be covered by several media outlets from around the world:
The March 2007 issue of Linux Format, the popular Linux magazine
from the UK, features a short review of Pardus by Ladislav Bodnar,
the maintainer of the Distrowatch website and a keen observer of the
Linux distro scene. From the review: <i>"Still looking for that perfect
desktop distro? Then don't overlook Pardus Linux 2007. It might not
be the hot favorite with the mainstream IT publications -- and it
certainly doesn't have the budget to plaster Linux websites with ads --
but this Turkish distro comes with enough innovation and polish to make
it one of the best new Linux distributions of 2007."</i> Thanks Beranger
for pointing out this one. The full review is available 
<a href=http://beranger.org/index.php?article=2382&from=rss>at his website</a>.

<p>

Thanks to our incredibly active <a href=http://pardus-linux.nl>user group Pardus-nl</a>
from the Netherlands, Pardus was also covered in episode 0x12 of N3RD-TV,
a video cast published every Friday covering computers and information
technology related news. You can watch 
<a href=http://n3rd.tv/2007/01/12/episode-0x12>whole episode here</a>.

<p>


Did you know that there are special Pardus coins
in circulation? The Anatolian panther Pardus Pantera Tulliana is largely
believed to be extinct and in 2005 the Turkish Mint has issued 5000 coins
commemorating this animal once roaming free in the Turkish forests. Minted
in 925 sterling silver, these special coins are currently being sold for
20 New Turkish Liras (about 11 euros) and they will be in circulation
until 12.27.2007. You can purchase yours online from the 
<a href=http://www.darphane.gov.tr>Turkish State Mint web site</a> 
(available in English and Turkish). Thanks for Baris Ozyurt for submitting this one.

<p>

Last but not least, for those who are interested, there is a Pardus map in Frappr, an on-line
service which provides an easy and fun way to visualize and interact
with other people around the world. If you wish to put your name on a
map of the Pardus community and see if there are other users in your
neighborhood, go ahead and register yourself for this on-line guest book
at <a href=http://www.frappr.com/pardus>Pardus Frapper page</a>.



<p><span class="baslik">News from wiki</span><p>

As you might know, the Turkish Pardus Wiki page has been offline for a
while now. During the past couple of weeks, the developers have been
busy doing a lot of work bringing the content up-to-date, overhauling
the  website, and moving it to a new and better server. Well, the good
news is that the new and much improved PardusWiki is finally open. The
completely redesigned website now supports multiple languages 
(<a href=http://en.pardus-wiki.org>English</a>, <a href=http://tr.pardus-wiki.org>Turkish</a>,
<a href=http://nl.pardus-wiki.org>Dutch</a> and <a href=http://it.pardus-wiki.org>Italian</a>
or now) and the word on the street is that the new
site will be eventually transformed into a portal hosting many Pardus
related sites in the near future. Please feel free to make full use of
this valuable resource and by all means try to make a contribution to
the project by improving on the available content.


<p><span class="baslik">Local events and news</span><p>

Pardus Turkish users have gathered in <a href=http://www.uekae.tubitak.gov.tr>TUBITAK</a>, 
to discuss the package management infrastructure and the SVN repositories since the 
number of total packages have exceeded 2000 lately - which makes it slightly hard to
manage. There are even some photos from the event, check them out from
<a href=http://cekirdek.pardus.org.tr/~caglar/gelistirici_toplantisi/>here</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">New and updated packages</span><p>


Another new batch of updates was released on 02.09.2007. Among
some 60 improvements, some noteworthy changes include the 12 security
updates, a newer kernel 2.6.18.6, openoffice.org 2.1.3, amarok 1.4.5,
macromedia-flash 9.0.31, virtualbox 1.3.3 and the new stable kquemu 1.1,
which was recently released under the GPL. There are also three new
packages in the official repositories namely:

<p>
<ul>
<li>gdb [0.6.3-2-2]: Ncurses GUI for gdb.
<li>stlport [5.1.0-1-2]: stl library for  C++.
<li>k3bmonkeyaudioplugin [3.1-1-1]: APE plug-in for K3b.
</ul>


Please make sure that you update your systems using the PiSi Package
Manager, which is accessible under TASMA's "System Preferences"
menu. Alternatively, you can enter the "pisi up" command on the console
screen with the superuser privileges.
