buildfarm
----------

This is the buildfarm framework which compiles Pardus source packages.

The framework is completely written in Python. It interfaces to PiSi API
for building and installing the binary packages found in the work queue.

The buildfarm also builds delta packages containing only the modified files between
consecutive buils.
