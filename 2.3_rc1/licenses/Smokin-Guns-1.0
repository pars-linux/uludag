[1] Public Domain, MIT, BSD typically do, while copyleft (GPL)
     does not.

[2] Some items may have corresponding .map files available for
     use with a level editor such as Radiant, but each file
     released will have its own accompanying restrictions as
     decided by the author.  Creative Commons by-nc-sa applies to
     most but not all raw artwork, so be careful with assuming
     what files are licensed with.

[3] Engine source is available at:
     http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/smokinguns on SVN.

[4] Windows build uses custom replacement files to avoid bugs
     introduced by OpenAL sound API merge and new file handling
     method.  These files are available in a zip file on
     SourceForge or may be sent by request (sparcdr@users.sf.net).
     Linux/UNIX uses revision 38 only and should not need further
     fixes.
