<p>
This application can install or update software located 
in Pardus repositories, as well as remove those 
unwanted from your system.

<p>
<h2>Installing a new software</h2>
<p>
In order to install a new sofware, do the following: 

<ol>
<li>Click on <b>Show uninstalled packages</b>
<li>Click on a package you want and read the package information.
<li>If you want to choose this package, click on the box next to it.
<li>Do the second and third items for all the packages you want to install
<li>Click on <b>Install Packages</b> and install them on your systm
</ol>

Duration of installation will depend on your bandwidth. A dialog
will appear on the screen showing the installation process. 

<h2>Upgrading a software</h2>

A software can be upgraded in order to increase 
security or add a function which is lacking in the
previous version. Therefore you must check for 
updates for your system from time to time.
<p>
In order to do this, run <b>Add, Upgrade or Remove Software</b>
and click on <b>Settings -> Repositories</b>. Here, click
on <b>Update All Repositories</b> button to update all the
repository information. 
<p>
Now your computer will connect to Pardus repository servers
and fetch a list of packages to be upgraded. After this
progress completes, click on all packages on the list and
click <b>Upgrade Packages</b> button. Pardus will 
automatically download and install necessary packages, 
resulting in an up-to-date system.
 
<h2>Searching for software</h2>

In order to search for a specific software or a 
definition of a software, enter the keyword(s) in the search
box. The word(s) you enter will be searched in 
the defined set of packages (i.e installed, uninstalled
or to-be upgraded).

<h2>Repository settings</h2>

Pardus can use more than one repository and download the 
software contained. To add a new repository, click on 
<b>Settings -> Repositories</b>. Here, you can modify 
repository settings by adding or deleting a repository, updating
a repository information and moving the repository up and down.
All changes will be active if Ok button is pressed.
