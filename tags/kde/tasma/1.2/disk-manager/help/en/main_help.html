                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
Disk Manager includes settings about disks and disk partitions on your
system. Disk Manager features additional settings based on file system
type (Ext2,Ext3,ReiserFS,XFS,NTFS or Fat16/32), directory (path) to
mount the disk to use on system, and disk type. You must open Disk
Manager in <b>Administrator Mode</b>  to apply disk changes !
                </p>
                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p></p><h3>Find Disks Automatically</h3>
If you're unsure about what you're doing, just click on <b>Find Disks Automatically</b>
button on the top left of the window. This feature allows Disk Manager
to detect and configure necessary settings about disk partitions on
your system automatically. <p></p>
                <p></p><h3>Details</h3>
If you want to configure settings of a disk partition, first you should
select related disk from the list. Making changes about a disk
partition is not enough to save the changes. You should press "Save"
button to save the changes on disk partitions. After saving the
changes, disk partitions will be automatically mounted to the system
and you should see the partitions from system window. Notice that:
after making any changes on disk partition, disk will be unmounted from
old mount point, and will be mounted to the new point with the new
preferences. But if disk partition is still in use on the old mount
point, unmount process won't work and preferences won't be valid till
next start. So in such situations, you should restart your machine to
validate new settings. </div>
