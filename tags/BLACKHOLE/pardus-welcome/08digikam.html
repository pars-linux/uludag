Touch your photos with elegance

Digikam is a simple digital photo management 
application which makes importing and 
organizing digital photos easy. The photos 
can be organized in albums which are 
automatically sorted chronologically. 
An easy-to-use interface is provided to 
connect to your camera, preview images, and
download or delete them.

The people who inspired digiKam's design 
are the photographers like you who 
want to view, manage, edit, enhance, 
organize, tag, and share photographs 
under Linux.
