##  Configuration file options:
##
##  Items not placed within a device block are considered global to all devices.
##  Device blocks are used to specify which devices are supported.  They are
##  defined as follows:
##
##    <device node>
##    {
##        type = <a supported type>;
##        <some options>;
##    };
##
##  All option lines are terminated with a semi-colon (;).  Command line
##  options that should get passed to any scripts/programs run are seperated
##  by commas (,).
##
##  The global options may be overridden on a per device basis.
##
##  The following is a list of options and a brief explanation of each:
##
##  user-config-enabled     This option can be set to yes or no.  If enabled,
##                          the file ~/.autorun.conf is parsed for
##                          user specific options.  The user configuration file
##                          overrides all options present.  The parsing is
##                          performed such that the entire global configuration
##                          file is parsed (/etc/autorun/autorun.inf), followed
##                          by the user configuration file (~/.autorun.conf),
##                          overriding any values set in the global
##                          configuration.
##
##  mount-point             This is the directory to mount the device onto upon
##                          detection of a new disc being inserted.  
##
##  wine-script             This is the name to the script that will start
##                          wine if an autorun.inf file is found on the root
##                          of a CD-ROM.  All programs that are executed
##                          inherit the permissions of the user starting the
##                          daemon.  See "options" below.
##
##  wine-office-script      This is the name of the script that is used to
##                          install Microsoft Office using wine.
##                          See "wine-script" above.
##
##  cd-audio                This is the name of the script or program that
##                          will be used if an audio CD is inserted.
##                          See "wine-script" above.
##
##  cd-data                 This is the name of the script or program that
##                          will be used if a data CD is inserted.
##                          See "wine-script" above.
##
##  cd-mixed                This is the name of the script or program that
##                          will be used if a mixed-mode CD is inserted (a CD
##                          that contains both Audio and Data).
##                          See "wine-script" above.
##
##  type                    This options sepcifies the type of device the
##                          autorun program is looking at.  Currently supported 
##                          values are "cdrom" only.  NOTE:  Must appear
##                          in a device block only.  Use "cdrom" for ALL CD-ROM
##                          devices (including SCSI) and use "scsi" for
##                          removable SCSI devices (ie, Zip, etc.).
##
##  autorun-wine            This option takes a "yes" or "no" argument
##                          specifying whether to parse an autorun.inf file on
##                          the root of an inserted CD. (DEFAULT: no)
##
##  autorun-loki            This option takes a "yes" or "no" argument
##                          specifying whether to check for a loki setup.sh file
##                          on the root of an inserted CD. (DEFAULT: no)
##
##  autorun-audio           This option takes a "yes" or "no" argument
##                          specifying whether or not audio CDs should be
##                          autorun. (DEFAULT: no)
##  
##  autorun-data            This option takes a "yes" or "no" argument
##                          specifying whether or not data CDs should be
##                          autorun. (DEFAULT: no)
##
##  autorun-mixed            This option takes a "yes" or "no" argument
##                           specifying whether or not mixed mode CDs should be
##                           autorun. (DEFAULT: no)
##
##
##  Options:
##
##  If you would like to pass command line options to any scripts/programs
##  being executed, they are specified using commas (,).  After each comma,
##  another option is specified.  The command line options are placed on the
##  same line as the script/program name.  The command line options are parsed
##  up to the first semi-colon encountered (;).
##
##  All non-expansion options should be placed within quotations (") to prevent
##  accidental expansion.
##
##  Options to pass may get expanded.  The following is a list of expansion
##  keywords and their meanings:
##
##        $d        Device Node
##        $v        Volume Label for media in the device.
##        $m        Mountpoint
##        $u        UID of the user running the daemon.
##        $g        GID of the user running the daemon.
