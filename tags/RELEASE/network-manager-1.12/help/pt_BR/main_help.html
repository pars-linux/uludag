<p>
<b>Network manager</b> can be used to configure network settings, 
in order to connect to internet, local area network, wireless 
network or dial-up services. It has a easy-to-use interface 
with the ability to connect you everywhere in seconds.

<p>
When the program is run the first time, you need to 
choose the type of connection and configure the settings.
Below, you can see each type of connection scheme.

<p>
<h2>Connecting with an ethernet card</h2>
<p>
Pardus Linux should already recognize your ethernet card 
to connect to an ethernet network. Follow these 
steps to connect using this method.

<ol>
<li>Run Network Manager
<li>Click on "Create".
<li>Choose "Ethernet network" 
<li>Click on "Create connection"
<li>Enter your connection name and choose the ethernet card
<li>Choose DHCP or enter your IP configuration
<li>Click on "Use" and exit from this window
<li>Click on "Connect". 
</ol>

You will immediately be connected to the network and 
a green icon will show up.
<p>

It should be sufficient to choose DHCP for Pardus
users having an ADSL or cable modem. 

<p>
If you click on "General settings", you can

<p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the name of your computer, or
<li>Select a DNS server 
</ol>

<p>
Usually, in a network environment where IP's are
distributed automatically (i.e, via DHCP), it's
sufficient to choose DHCP to let computers 
have their IP and connect to internet.
<p>

<h2>Connecting with a wireless card</h2>
<p>

A wireless card connection looks like the same as 
an ethernet connection. The most important difference
is the name of the wireless network, i.e the ESSID. 
Some networks require you to choose this name.

<p>


<ol>
<li>Run Network Manager
<li>Click on "Create"
<li>Click on "Wireless Network" and "Create Connection" 
<li>Enter the connection name, choose the wireless card and ESSID.
</ol>

<p>

You may also click on "Scan" and get a list of wireless
networks which can be currently seen by your system. 

<p>

<h2>Connecting with a modem</h2>
<p>

Follow these steps to connect with a modem. Note
that some modems specifically designed for other
operating systems may not work under Linux.

<p>

<ol>
<li>Run Network Manager
<li>Click on "Create"
<li>Click on "Dialup network" and "Create connection"
<li>Enter the connection name, the serial port modem uses (usually COM1) and phone number of your service provider.
<li>Click on "Authentication" tab 
<li>Enter your user name and password
</ol>
<p>

Now click on "Connect", and your modem will activate
