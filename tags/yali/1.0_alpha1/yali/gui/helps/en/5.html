Other than the system administrator user,
you can create a user account for your 
daily needs, i.e reading your e-mail, surfing
on the web and searching for daily recipe
offerings. Usual password assignment
rules also apply here: This password should 
be unique and private. Choose a password 
difficult to guess, but easy to remember.
