These are the items you should consider before giving your language support to Pardus. Most of the user interface and help files are in po format, so an editor which can read and write po files (i.e Kbabel or Poedit) will be sufficient. 

After installing Pardus, downloading kdesdk package will install Kbabel and place an entry in Pardus menu.
