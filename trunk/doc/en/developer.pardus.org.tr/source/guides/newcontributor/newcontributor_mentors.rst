Who are mentors?
================

The component supervisors, team leaders, lead developers are the mentors of developer candidates. (See `developer roles`_ for details)

What is the aim of this notion?
===============================

Pardus `mentoring process`_ allows expected developers to work together with experienced developers as mentors. The aim is to increase Linux knowledge and Pardus Linux Community with helping contributors profusely.

What are Mentoring Responsibilities?
====================================

There are not a specific set of rules for mentoring but we can give a few general hints in order to assist a new contributor:

    A mentor may get a large volume of questions from new contributors, therefore they:
        * Should be familiar with the subjects that will be mentoring
        * Should be available and easy to reach
        * Should know how to balance your time and resources
