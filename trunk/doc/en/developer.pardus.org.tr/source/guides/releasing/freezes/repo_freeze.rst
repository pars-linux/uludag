Repo Freeze
===========

This freeze occurs at the end of the milestone `Alpha 3`_ phase. At repo freeze event, `devel source repository`_ is branched to `test source repository`_. All packages merges from previous Pardus release and `new package additions`_ must be finsihed with this deadline. `Feature freeze`_ is also held a while before this time. Shortly after release enters string freeze. These allow the release stabilize and enter a bug-fix and polish phase (`Beta Phase`_) of development.

New packages and features can be added under some `exceptional circumstances`_.
