The planning phase is a phase to give a start to a new release and takes
about 1 month.

All users and developers request features to `Pardus Bugzilla`_ before `feature request`_ 
deadline. After this deadline requested features are reviewed and accepted until `feature
acceptence`_ deadline.

The possible technological changes are continously tried on devel source
repository, and the feasibility of accepted features should be decided
by the end of this phase

The requested features are reviewed and also prioritized during this period
and no more features are added to this list.

The roadmap of the release is planned during this phase. Requirements and
specifications freeze.

Planning Phase Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Proposed features are discussed by developers, reviewed by technical group and the final feature list is determined.
#. The planned feature list and the release plan/schedule should be announced
#. Pre-alpha should be released

Planning Phase Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to release the pre-alpha, the following criteria should be met:

* There must be no unhandled file conflicts and missing package dependencies in the repository
* Pre-alpha image should boot correctly into a working development environment

Planning Phase (Pre-alpha) Schedule
