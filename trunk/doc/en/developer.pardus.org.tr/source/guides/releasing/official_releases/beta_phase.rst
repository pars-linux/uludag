==========

:Version: 0.2

Beta phase is bug fixing and detailed test phase in order to stabilize new
release and takes about 1 month.

At the end of the beta phase, software should be `code complete`_, indicating
that there are only critical bug fixes left. Code complete version of a software
is almost similar to final.

During this phase Beta `tracker bugs`_ should also be fixed.

Beta phase has also rapid changes and so the software can be unstable and could
cause crashes or data loss.
