Pardus Target Audience and Package Inclusion and Update Vision

The person whom wants to use Pardus probably:

Package Inclusion and Update Vision
-----------------------------------

Visible behaviour changes will affect user experience, because these changes keep away users from their daily usage and users must spent time to discover what has changed. This outcome is undesirable. Therefore package inclusion and update vision is come to the fruition under this idea.

This vision is rationale for Pardus official repositories.

    * Instead of adding new packages with same functionality, we try to hardenning the functionality of existed packages' daily usage desktop experience
    * All desktop applications have Turkish localization (This is a must due to Pardus Project Vision)
    * Stable repository updates should be consistent and high quality stream of updates.
    * Stable repository should provide a consistent user experience throughout the release lifecycle, and only fix bugs and security issues.
    * Stable releases should not be used for tracking upstream version closely when this is likely to change the user experience beyond fixing bugs and security issues.
    * Close tracking of upstream should be done in the devel repository wherever possible, and we should strive to move our patches upstream.
    * Stable, testing and devel repositories have different approaches to what types of updates are expected. For example, testing should accept some updates which a stable release would not, and devel would accept updates that are not appropriate for either stable or testing repository.
    * All developers should be able to transparently measure or monitor a new updates process to objectively measure its effectiveness, and determine whether the updates process is achieving the aforementioned vision statements.
