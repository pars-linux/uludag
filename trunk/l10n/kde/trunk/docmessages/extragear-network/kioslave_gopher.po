"Gopher is an Internet information browsing service that uses a menu-driven "
"interface. Users select information from menus, which may return another "
"menu or display a text file. An item may reside on a Gopher server you "
"originally queried, or it may be on another Gopher server (or another host). "
"Gopher can <quote>tunnel</quote> from one Gopher to another without the user "
"knowing that the server and/or host machine have changed. Gopher keeps the "
"exact location of computers hidden from the user, providing the "
"<quote>illusion</quote> of a single, large set of interconnected menus."

"Gopher permits the user to record an item's location in a <quote>bookmark</"
"quote> thereby allowing users to follow a <quote>bookmark</quote> directly "
"to a particular item without searching the menu system. Gopher menus are not "
"standardized, inasmuch as each Gopher server is individually determined."
