Here we take notes of the strange stuff, so we can refactor them after
Pardus 2007 release.


==> Locale support
* bindtextdomain and textdomain calls are not necessary, because
gettext.translation() dont use them.

* setlocale call is probably necessary for some stuff, but not for
message translation, it seems gettext.translation() api looks for
environment LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES anyway.

* pygettext.py shouldn't be needed at all. Plain xgettext works with
python source.


==> Utility functions
* sha1_file is suboptimal for binary files and sha1_data has some
exception confusion. These two functions should be a lot simpler.

* get_file_hashes is overly complex and contains strange code like:
for r, d, f in os.walk(parent, topdown=False): pass

* dir_size tries to calculate symlink lengths, this is probably not very
helpful, since in most cases, they fit in the inode, and wont take any
extra space at all. We can keep the number of file in the index though.
That way we can calculate package size + (nr of files * inode size of fs)
to give a more correct required disk size.

* what the heck is unzip there? it is not even used at all and defined like:
def unzip(seq):
    return zip(*seq)

* Why in a world like this there exists *parse_package* util functions? These must be all methods of package class

* Remove all unneeded util functions, most of them belongs its classes

==> code readability
* Public functions should contain doc strings.

* Python builtins like file, list, etc should be avoided in variable names.
There is even a file.py module!

* a,b,c,d,f,r,_i are equally bad.

* some import'ed modules are not used inside the importer modules, cleanup needed.

* Would be very good if we can avoid "from x import y" form, it makes it
harder to reload modules.

* Convert all String Concatenation into "%s" % string form which is much faster, readable and correct

==> exceptions
* Current model is bad. Exception names should tell what is the error type. Instead
we have one Error exception in every module. If I call pisi.api.install("lala"),
I should get pisi.api.PackageNotFound or pisi.install.PackageNotFound or something
like that. For every kind of error, you get pisi.api.Error now, and only way to find
out exact error is try to parse error string (which is localized).

* class Exception(Exception) is evil.

* There shouldn't be a bare Except: clause in pisi modules.


==> database
* brr...


==> class attributes
* In some classes there are some attributes assigned but never
used. (see remove_unused_attributes.patch)

* PiSi uses heavy classes and creates thousands of instances of them
  (Package, Metadata, Dependency, ...). These classes should define
  __slots__ to reduce the heap used.


==> actionsAPI
* Get rid of ugly exception model
* Refactor/clean the code
* Add strict checks to models
* Add more models like cmake
* Maybe? Get rid of functional logic, switch to OO one
* ActionsAPI still needs an updated API document


==> PiSi API
* Write a real one


==> Function parameters
* Check function parameters and see if some parameters (especially the
ones named tmpDir/tmp_dir/target_dir) are redundant now. See
http://liste.uludag.org.tr/uludag-commits/2007-February/010070.html

* conflict.py
conflicts method takes a pkg_name parameter but doesn't use it at all


==> Fixes (that need API breakage)
* http://liste.uludag.org.tr/uludag-commits/2007-February/010117.html

==> Logging

* Improve logging with all needed update/downgrade/install/remove information so one can easily find the history of packages, 
currently PiSi wrotes everyting into logs which is not usefull. Also this information can be used for rollback and reporting.
