What is it?
-----------

donbili (which stands for 'donanım bilgileri' in Turkish) is an easily extensible Python
script which collects useful hardware informations about your system.

Why do you reinvent the wheel?
------------------------------

I'm quite sure that there are tons of hardware collector scripts/utilities around. To search and
refactor them for a distribution's needs takes much more time then writing a new one from scratch.

And also, I'm bored at home on this beautiful saturday night. Yes, believe me.

What type of information does it collect?
-----------------------------------------

1. Basic informations (In all cases)

    1.0. dmesg
    1.1. lspci
    1.2. lsusb
    1.3. DMI data from /sys/class/dmi/id

2. CPU Informations

    1.1. A simplified portion of /proc/cpuinfo
    1.2. Available and in-use cpufreq governor if any
    1.3. Some ACPI informations like temperature, current frequency, etc.

2. Graphical Informations

    2.0. /var/log/Xorg.0.log
    2.1. Current resolution, dpi, depth
    2.2. Some useful informations from xrandr, glxgears maybe

3. Audio devices

    3.1. alsa-info --no-upload

4. Disk and memory usage

    4.1. free -m
    4.2. df -h

5. Partitioning/Mounting

    5.1. foreach disk; fdisk -l <disk>
    5.2. /etc/fstab
    5.3. blkid output

6. Slow booting (Pardus specific)

    6.1. /var/log/udevmonitor.log

7. Printers

    7.1. /var/log/cups/*

8. Webcams

    8.1. test-webcam output


Are there any features to be implemented?
------------------------------------------

- Plain text output,
- Optional tarball with a separate text file for every section,
- A Bugzilla hook which can send the final report as an attachment to a new bug report.

How to use it?
