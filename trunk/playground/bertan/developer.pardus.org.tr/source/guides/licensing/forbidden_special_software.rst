Forbidden Software and Special Cases
====================================

Users or contributors sometimes ask why certain software are not exist in Pardus repositories. Pardus Project includes free and `opensource <http://opensource.org/>`_ software in its repositories. Our :ref:`licensing-guidelines` reinforce the following requirements:

    * Any non-distributable proprietary item,
    * Any obscure licensed item cannot be included in Pardus repositories.

We recommend you to choose right `hardware <http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw>`_ that completely work with free and open source software. 

Proprietary Kernel Drivers
--------------------------

Many kernel developers consider that the proprietary drivers are harmful, because the source code are not open and the security fixes can only be done by their owners. Therefore Pardus only allows these drivers under `some circumstances <http://developer.pardus.org.tr/guides/licensing/licensing_guidelines.html#binary-firmware>`_.


NVIDIA and ATI Accelerated Graphics Drivers
-------------------------------------------

They are proprietary drivers, Pardus only allows these drivers under `some circumstances <http://developer.pardus.org.tr/guides/licensing/licensing_guidelines.html#binary-firmware>`_.

Sun's Java
----------

Sun's Java has a `freely redistributable license <http://download.java.net/dlj/DLJ-FAQ-v1.1.txt>`_, but some part of it has some obscurity. Our repositories have only freely redistributable part of it.

Adobe/Macromedia Flash Player
-----------------------------

While it is a proprietary software, the open source alternatives are very weak. But it has a `license <http://www.adobe.com/products/eula/tools/flash_paper2.html>`_, therefore Pardus allows this software under `some circumstances <http://developer.pardus.org.tr/guides/licensing/licensing_guidelines.html#binary-firmware>`_.


Adobe Acrobat Reader
--------------------

It is a proprietary software and the open source alternatives are adequate like kpdf (KDE3), okular (KDE4). So Pardus does not allow to use this software under `these circumstances <http://developer.pardus.org.tr/guides/licensing/licensing_guidelines.html#binary-firmware>`_.
