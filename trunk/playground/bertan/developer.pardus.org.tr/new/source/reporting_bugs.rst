What is a Bug?
----

Sometimes software programs do not produce the result that they are supposed to produce or crash, stall, stuck in certain situations. In software world we tend to blame imaginary "bugs" to cause these undesired situations. We do not want our software to host these bugs, but we cannot always see them. So you are welcome to report the bugs you encounter.

Pardus uses Bugzilla software to keep track of the bugs reported. You can report the bugs you encounter using Pardus Bugzilla at http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/.

Is This a Bug?
----

Errenously people tend to use Bugzilla in the following situations; so please do not report a bug if:

* **Request a New feature / Package**: You can use our brainstorm software to suggest new features to our existing software or new software packages to be supported.
* **Help**
