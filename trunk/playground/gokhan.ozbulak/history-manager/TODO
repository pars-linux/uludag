Calendar:
    * Calendar should be marked based on operations fetched from historydb [OK]

Pop-Up:
    * Pop-Up should be populated with operations realized in given date
    * No pop-up for dates that don't have any operations
    * Different operations on given date should be segmented (with different background color etc.)

Main Window:
    * A refresh button may be a good idea to populate calendar if historydb has been changed from cli
