This directory provides the list of packages which are shipped with the ISO images.
These lists are then used by buildfarm to generate delta packages.

You can use the python script create-package-list.py to generate a cPickled dictionary.
Simply give it the binary repository index file either in plain xml or bz2 compressed :

$ create-package-list.py pisi-index.xml.bz2
