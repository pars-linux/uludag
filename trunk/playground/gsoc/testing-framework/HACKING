1.	Follow the Python PEP 8 style guide as much as possible

2.	Read the 'Zen of Python' PEP 20

3.	Naming Convention
	Functions and Methods: lower_case_with_underscore
	Variables: mixedCase
	Instance Variables: lowercase

4.	Imports should be in the following order:

	standard library imports
	related third party imports
	local application/ library specific imports

	Yes: 	import os
		import sys

	No: 	import sys, os 
  
	Never:  import os
		from myclass import MyClass
		import sys
      
		from myclass import *

	The imports always go at the top of the file

5.	Avoid using magic numbers
	If you have to, make sure you write comment the code properly

6.	And finally, if you think you will be able to understand your 
	code two years from now, you are good to go!
