Pardus Testing Framework
------------------------

The aim of this project is to create a testing framework for Pardus
which will interpret and execute XML-based test case files
and then send the results back to the testing team - all with minimum user intervention. 

There are two major components of this project:

1. Interpretation and execution of XML test case files.
2. Allowing the testing team to easily create the test case files.
