Pardus Testing Framework
------------------------

The aim of this project is to implement a testing framework for Pardus that allows the
Pardus testing team and other developers to easily test their software, all with minimum
user intervention. 


How it works:
-------------

i.   The developer/ tester create a XML testcase file and send it over to the user. 
ii.  The framework on the user's end interprets the XML file and carries out the required tests. 
iii. The test data and report is then sent back to the developer/ tester. 

All this is done with the minimum effort on part of the end user.

There are two major components of this project:

1. Interpretation and execution of XML testcase files.
2. Creation of XML testcase files.


Technical details:
------------------

The testing framework would run on Python 2.6 and requires the 'lxml' library, 
which is required for both parsing and the creation of the XML testcase files.
