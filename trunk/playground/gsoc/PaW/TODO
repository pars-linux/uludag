TODO
--------------------

* boot.ini backup system
* safe boot.ini cleaner upon uninstallation

* grub4dos record removal method using bcdedit safely
* bcdedit backup system (if possible) + restore tool

* solve gui freezing problem during installation.

* edit initramfs to boot CD properly from nested folder other than device root.

* plan more on installation directory structure

* Live CD or ISO detection feature for versions prior to Pardus 2011, prevent
  usage of those Install CDs or Install ISO files.

* grub4dos installer (grldr, menu.lst). copy files to the destinations.

* idea of renaming grldr as parldr (any better ideas in terms of 8.3 naming
  convention?)

* plan about uninstall script.

* verify kernel, initrd, img PATHs from 2009, and 2009.1, live CDs.
