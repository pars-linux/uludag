TODO
--------------------

* solve gui freezing problem during installation.

* make initramfs to boot CD properly from nested folder other than device root.
  update kernel params, accordingly.

* do not allow install CDs, ISOs, USBs. look for repo/ folder and prevent it.

* decide on a a stable URL for version definition xml file.

* test installing on a different partition than primary windows boot drive(C:).

* Live CD or ISO detection feature for versions prior to Pardus 2011, prevent
  usage of those Install CDs or Install ISO files.

* grub4dos installer (grldr, menu.lst). copy files to the destinations.

* idea of renaming grldr as parldr (any better ideas in terms of 8.3 naming
  convention?)

* plan about uninstall script. 

* verify kernel, initrd, img PATHs from 2009, and 2009.1, live CDs.

* vendor, version, release props for exe app.

* better graphical interface.

* py2exe builds.
    * redirect stdout, stderr to tmp folder, move to logs upon finish.
    * include required files (images, xml files) in the distribution.
    * optimize bytecode
    * remove _ssl module (to be discussed)
    * 

* create pardus 2009 packages for paw-specific installations.

* test installing with downloaded file

* WUBI of Ubuntu conflicts with PaW because of having same menu.lst in c:\.
  and we may delete it upon uninstallation!

* if there is a Pardus folder under installation root, do not allow proceed,
  first uninstall the program and then let the user continue. plan more on the
  scenario. we can warn the user at the beginning of the program if there is
  Pardus key in the appropriate registry path. (folder already exist?)

* split installer and uninstaller py files?
