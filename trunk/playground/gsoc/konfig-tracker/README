Konfig-Tracker is Free Software,released under the GNU General Public License( GPL version 2).

It is a snapshot and monitoring tool for KDE4 Settings.

DESCRIPTION:

------------

konfig-tracker sits in your system tray and notifies all the changes to kde4 settings.In the main window, it shows the list of backups done.

It displays the files changed during each backup and patch corresponding to the change.

konfigtracker-tracker has a git working at its backend as database.

In the absense of database,konfig-tracker creates $KDEDIR/konfigtracker-db,initialises a git repo here,copies all the configuration files from $KDEDIR/share/config here and commit it to git repo as 'initial backup'.

This directory is monitored and changes are committed to git repo and thus backup is done.Using KStatusNotifier these changes are notified to user.

Main window displays these backups as current database status.Corresponding to each backup it shows the list of files changed using a QTreeWidget and selecting each file out of this displays the changes to it.

Restore:

It restores the configuration files to the selected backup.

On restoring,commit-id of selected backup is used to checkout the corresponding commit from git repo and configuration files get restored to the selected backup configurations.

Export Configurations:

It stores the selected backup as filename.tar.gz archieve file in the location as specified by the user.

Using path and file name string supplied by user konfig-tracker creates filename.tar.gz at the desired location with git-archieve command
