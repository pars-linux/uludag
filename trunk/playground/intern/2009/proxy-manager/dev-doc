Using comments in different files seemed like an inefficient
way to tell some implementation details of this software, so
here are some info which may be important in the future for 
some reason :)

== Importing the modules ==
...........

== Implementing config file parsers ==
Although the configuration files of the apps have similarities
almost all of the apps needed its own module because of small
differences in their configuration file structures. These are:
  1) File structure type:
    xml: pidgin, amsn (with very different structures)
    javascript: mozilla
    key-value pairs: kde, gftp, aria2, wget
    key-value pairs (with sections unignorable): svn
  2) Inactivation of an option:
    delete the line: svn, mozilla, wget
    delete the value: pidgin, kde, gftp, aria, amsn
  3) Keys of the options:
    Almost all of them are different. Although, there are
    similarities among some of them, not all of the options
    have the same key or are available for all.
  4) Existence of the config file:
    generated after install:
    generated after first use:
    generated by the module itself:

However, the info other than the proxy related stuff "must be
preserved" in all of these files, so, all parsers for the config
files try not to violate this rule.
