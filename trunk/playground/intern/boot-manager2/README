  TODO:

1) Instead of stacked widgets, make popup dialogs.
2) Add layouts to some widgets, which were ignored at the beginning.
3) Test EditWidget in case there is a Windows entry in grub.conf.
4) Generate .po files.
5) Try to expedite boot-manager.py by removing redundant code snippets.
6) Port boot-manager.py to qt4.
