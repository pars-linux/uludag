YALI is Yet Another Linux Installer. It is the installer that sets up
the system by installing packages from the installation media (eg. CD,
network, Internet) and carrying out the basic configuration. YALI is
intended to be smooth in operation and fast in performance. It's written in
Python using Qt4.

for creating live cd with installer

checkout pardusman from
http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/kde/pardusman/

checkout distribution files from
http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag/trunk/distribution/

open pardusmanproject.xml with pardusman.py and enter path for distribution files
make package changes if you want and save xml

make your iso with yaliTestMaker

**make sure of
-yali-live installed (sudo python setup.py install)
-pardus-branding-files installed

sudo python yaliTestMaker.py -p path_to_pardusman/pardusman.py -f path_distribution_files/pardusmanproject.xml -w /tmp/iso/x86_64/

*your iso will be in /tmp/iso/x86_64/

*there are some hardcoded parts in yaliTestMaker.py

-like copying branding file from
/usr/share/yali/branding/pardus/release.xml

-you should give path for branding file from this directory
( or it gives stack error :) 

-and change hardcoded lines about python version


*Other things
I made some changes for pardusman
open pardusman/repotools/project.py

clean live_exclude list if you want
or it will delete manpages, infos and logs
