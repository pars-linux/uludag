<font color=#404040> Welcome to Pardus, an easy to install and use system, with many enhancements
to desktop usability, compatibility and security. With Pardus, you can 
connect to Internet, read your e-mails, securily communicate with
your friends and exploit your computer's multimedia capability by listening

http://www.uludag.org.tr/eng to explore new Pardus opportunities.  </font>

<p>
<h2>Basic system requirements</h2>
<font color=#404040>While Pardus will work on any modest hardware, we recommend that you 
have at least 256 Mb of RAM and 1200 Mhz CPU. While these are two very basic 
conditions to let Pardus work in an effective way, the minimum requirements can be set 
as follows:

<p>

<ul>
<li>192 Mb of RAM (<b>at least 256 Mb recommended</b>)
<li>800 Mhz Intel or AMD CPU (<b>at least 1200 MHz recommended</b>)
</ul>

<p>

We also recommend broadband internet connection (i.e. ethernet, wireless etc.) 
to reach Pardus services and be able to download many other productivity 
software.

A sound card will automatically be detected and used after you install Pardus. 
You will need to configure your printer with a straightforward process 
in your first login.
