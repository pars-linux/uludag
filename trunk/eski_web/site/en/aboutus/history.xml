      <para>
        The preparation for the Turkish Linux Distribution (Uluda) project dates back more than one year. We are aware that a sound preparation is as important as good planning and fast execution for the success of the project. Thus, we preferred not the start Uludag project till the project foundation matured enough.

      <title>Concept</title>
      <para>
	Through most of 2003 we have carried extensive research on the necessity of a national operating system distribution, similar initiatives around the globe, the current position and trends of local software industry. Information technology applications and software of critical national importance have been reviewed. National human resources, capabilities of the local software industry and competitive advantages have been analyzed. This research paved way to the decision to develop a national Linux distribution, in Summer 2003.

      <title>Decision</title>
      <para>
	Following the decision to develop a national Linux distribution, a rather concrete planning phase started. Present operating systems and distributions, foremost Linux distributions, have been examined. SWOT (Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat) analyses for these have been carried out. Open source software methodology and the underlying philosophy have been recited thoroughly. New business models for software industry, especially in the open source context, have been studied since we aim to found a sustainable organization, in addition to developing a distribution. In Fall 2003, we have reached the conclusion that a Linux-based, open source, distribution licensed through GPL to the extent possible has to be developed.

      <title>Foundation</title>
      <para>
	After deciding on a Linux-based operating system distribution detail planning has started. Processes for developing a Linux distribution have been identified and possible human resource requirements have been determined. Open source software repository has been searched and sources that may be reused for the distribution have been pointed out. Different distributions have been studied and compared in terms of their target groups, development methodologies and business models. Alternatives have been established. By Fall 2003 the basic components of the project plan for the distribution have been completed.

      <title>Team</title>
      <para>
	Since the project plan emerged to a certain degree, it was time to focus on more technical aspects. The core of the team to design the architecture and develop the national distribution has been selected and employed. Special emphasis is placed on the history of Linux in Turkey, existing and planned distributions, open source and Linux community and initiatives, and utmost importance is given to make use of the present know-how and experience. By the end of 2003 the core team has been established and the execution of the project has started.

      <title>Plan</title>
      <para>
	Work on detail plan for Uludag project has started, following the identification of the basic components of a Linux distribution and the relevant processes. For the sake of flexibility and manageability the Uludag project has been divided into (sub) projects, and the scope for these projects has been determined. The infrastructure for developing the distribution has been itemized and a successive plan for deploying this infrastructure has been initiated. The basic components of Uludag, that will be developed mainly in-house, have been identified and requirement analyses for these have been carried out. By early 2004 the Plan phase has been completed and the Design phase has started.
