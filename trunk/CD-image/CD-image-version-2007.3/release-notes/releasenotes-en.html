<h2>2. Basic features</h2>

This section describes the Pardus 2007.3 features.

<h3>2.1 Updated network manager</h3>

Network manager now remembers the last connection and tries to connect
to known connections. It also gives information via a popup from 
taskbar which makes network manager more intuitive and user friendly.

<h3>2.2 Improved package management system</h3>

Package manager is more polished now. Many bugs in bug tracker have been
fixed. 

<h3>2.3 YALI </h3>

YALI (yet another Linux installer) now asks questions first, and then 
installs the system. This provides a more flexible and time saving
procedure. User also can decide whether to login to desktop automatically
or not. Last but not least, it includes definitions for state-of-the-art
hard disks, in order to ease installation process.

Moreover, YALI can understand whether a disk is bootable or not, and decide 
which disk to install Pardus on. This feature is first introduced
in Pardus distribution.
