Caracal caracal

In the whole wild cat family, no other cat can be as Turkish as Caracal caracal... It follows the every step of Turks in history. That's why in Latin nomenclature its name comes up from a Turkish word; Karakulak, the "black ear"...

Its ears are controlled by 20 different muscles to help it find its prey. The tufts of its fur help pinpoint the prey.

Caracal caracal is spread over Central Asia, Middle East and Africa. It's a fiercely territorial medium-sized cat. Caracal caracal is labeled as a small cat, but is amongst the heaviest of all small cats, as well as the fastest. Caracal caracal is 65-75 cm in length (about 2 ft), plus 30 cm tail (about 1 foot). Males typically weigh about 13-18 kg.


Caracal caracal resembles a Eurasian Lynx and for a long time it was considered a close relative of the lynxes. Recent DNA research, however, has shown that Caracal caracal is not a close relative of lynxes at all, but is instead related to the Serval. It has longer legs and a slimmer appearance than a lynx. The colour of its fur varies: it may be wine-red, grey or sand-coloured.

Its habitat is dry steppes and semi-deserts, but also includes woodlands, savanna, and scrub forest. It can easily survive in highlanded regions. Caracal caracal may survive without water for long periods. It hunts at night for rodents and hares; rarely it may even attack a gazelle, a small antelope or a young ostrich. It is most well-known for its skill with hunting birds; Caracal caracal is able to snatch a bird in flight, sometimes more than one at a time.

Caracal caracal is one of the endangered species. Because it is so easily tamed, Caracal caracal is sometimes kept as a pet, and is said to adapt easily to living with humans. Since it is also surprisingly easy to tame, it has been used as a hunting cat in Iran and India. It is also seen in South Taurus, Konya basin and Southeast Anatolia. The first photograph of Caracal caracal has been shot by Batur Avgan from Atlas magazine in 1997. The photograph that is going to be your default wallpaper has been photographed by Martin Harwey and associated by WWF Turkey.
