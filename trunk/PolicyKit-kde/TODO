IMPORTANT:
* Fix admin user selection support (another eventloop solution may be required)
* Fix dbus-qt3-backport's activation problem. Now, we can't use policykit-kde with dbus activation, it starts with kde.

LESS IMPORTANT:
* Do not send same DBus exceptions to all errors
* Inform user that authentication is not granted
* Use polkit_grant_cancel_auth in handler of DBus signal NameOwnerChanged
* Show details about the application request for authorization
* Check if authentication is in progress, when a new request arrived
* Control XID and add 'transient for'
* Add vendor icon support
* Check "Password: " prompt like polkit-gnome
* Review deconstructors for leaks, unrefs and closing connections
* Handle exceptions wisely :)
* Announcement in HAL mailing list
