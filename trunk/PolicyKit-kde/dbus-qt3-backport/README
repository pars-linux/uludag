This is a backport of Harald Fernengel's Qt4 D-Bus bindings.

Some Qt4 based code had no direct equivalent in Qt3. Cases where this
transition to Qt3 might not be fully correct are marked with FIXME-QT4

Depending on the use case it might be necessary to extend QDBusMesssage
to allow marshalling/de-marshalling based on an application provided
helper as the Qt3 QVariant can not handle all cases the Qt4 pendant can
(user defined types, etc)

In order to build you need to copy or symlink the kde-common/admin directory
into this directory and then run

make -f Makefile.cvs

to generate the configure script.
