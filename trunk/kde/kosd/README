A kded module for displaying plasma themed OSD's on KDE4.

Based on the work accomplished by Marcel Hasler, see:

KDED modularization and cleaning was done by Ozan Çağlayan

What does it contain?
---------------------

It currently contains 2 separate OSD implementations:

    - kosd_osd: Nice Plasma themed with icon/label support borrowed from the KOSD project
                (http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/KOSD?content=81457)
    - kmix_osd: A simple Plasma themed OSD meter with icon support borrowed from KMix
                (http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/4.4/kdemultimedia/kmix/osdwidget.cpp?view=markup)

How to use it?
--------------

Simply open a D-Bus session bus connection and call showOSD(string iconName, string label, int percent)
method on the org.kde.KOSD interface:

    /*
    currentVolume = getCurrentVolume();
    QDBusConnection dbus(QDBusConnection::sessionBus());
    QDBusInterface iface("org.kde.kded", "/modules/kosd", "org.kde.KOSD", dbus);
    iface.call("showOSD", "audio-volume-high", "some-label", currentVolume);
    */
