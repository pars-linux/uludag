* Kernel/initramfs/drivers (Ozan Çağlayan)
    - Find a way for being able to ship saa7134-alsa kernel module (#3478),
    - s2disk problems/support,
    - It seems that pardus logo on VTs aren't rendered when splash is enabled.

* KDE
    - Some Turkish characters like İ,Ü,etc. are rendered as I, U even the translations
    are correct (dejavu-fonts problem),
    - Logout pictures are not rendered correctly when effects are disabled,
    - kbluetooth4 has no translations, goes background when no device is available without
    notifying the user. It crashes when the dongle is suddenly unplugged,
    - KDE can't have backtrace information.

* gfxboot (Onur Küçük)
    - vga= entry appears twice on /proc/cmdline.

* Disk stuff (Ozan Çağlayan)
    - Written data to vfat partitions gets flushed upon umount which is bad.

* Firefox
    - backspace doesn't work,
    - libbonobo, libgnomeui stuff can be merged to pardus/ for fully compatible firefox,

* YALI (Gökmen GÖKSEL - Faik Uygur)
    - Pisi install whole packages from start after a package fail.
