<H1 ALIGN=center>Speeding Up Linux: One Step Further With Pardus</H1>

<H3 ALIGN=center>Gürer Özen, Görkem Çetin</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Abstract: </B>
For a long time, Linux has been blamed to boot slowly, compared to
other modern operating systems. In this article, we are going to focus
on a new init system we developed for our Pardus Linux distribution,
Mudur, together with other initiatives that are worth mentioning.
Mudur is written from scratch in Python with simplicity, speed and
maintainability in mind. It isn't a replacement for the /sbin/init
command like some other alternatives, nor just a parallel script executor.
Mudur greatly simplified our boot process, making it faster and more
flexible. Authors look forward for future boot process research for
further improvement and optimizations.<br><br>
You may download and try our 1.1 alpha3 release to see Mudur and Pardus
distribution in action from <a href='ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/kurulan/1.1-Alpha3'>

<!--TOC section Problem-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc1">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem</H2><!--SEC END -->

Distrowatch.com lists more than 400 distributions, most of which are
used for everyday lives at home. Similarly, most, if not all, of the
distros listed have been derived from other major distributions such
as Slackware, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc. This gives developers a high
degree of freedom and re-use of existing components, i.e a stable
base system, package repositories, a great multitude of patches and
security fixes. A recent study[<A HREF="#key-16"><CITE>1</CITE></A>] has enabled for Linux
newcomers to have an idea about the roots of distributions.<BR>
<BR>
While there's always a hot, ongoing debate about which package manager
to use, Pardus developers have chosen not to rely on any package managers
and decided to roll a brand new one. This may seem like a re-invention
of the wheel, however one of the core developers, Çaglar Onur, claims
that a new approach to build packages with PiSi gives extreme flexibility
for packagers. The new package manager, PiSi (packages installed successfully
as intended) is completely written in Python. While PiSi deserves
a full article of its own, we'll be focusing on another new approach,
also written in Python, Pardus presents, a new init framework called
Mudur<SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP> which primarily focuses on notoriously slow and complex initialization
system of Linux.<BR>
<BR>
Before starting to dig into Mudur, let's investigate how other technologies
lead to a better init system. IBM has initially worked on a parallelization
model[<A HREF="#key-2"><CITE>2</CITE></A>] which shows how to improve the boot speed of a
Linux system without compromising usability. The technique merely
involves parallelization of services during boot time and reduce startup
time of the whole system. Probably all readers interested in init
systems have an in-depth knowledge about Initng[<A HREF="#key-5"><CITE>5</CITE></A>], which
dramatically decreases the boot up duration and already used by some
distributions. Initng is a full replacement of the old sysvinit tool.
It is designed to significantly increase the speed of booting a unix-compatible
system by starting processes asynchronously. Last but not least, another
alternative depinit[<A HREF="#key-8"><CITE>7</CITE></A>] has been driving attention for quite
some time, with the ability to handle parallel execution, dependencies,
true roll-back, pipelines, improved signaling and unmounting filesystems
on shutdown. According to the developers, it's somehow experimental
and requires some time to incorporate an existing system.<BR>
<BR>
While Linux is blamed to boot slower for some time, the work ongoing
listed above will lead to faster boot times in conjuction with steady
and consistent advances in CPU speeds, cache improvements and dropping
of hard disk seek times. Believe it or not, this has been a serious
issue in other operating systems like MacOS X or MS Windows. For example,
in Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger, Apple introduced a new system startup program
called launchd. The launchd daemon takes over many tasks from cron,
xinetd, mach_init, and init, which are UNIX programs that traditionally
have handled system initialization, called systems scripts, run startup
items, and generally prepared the system for the user[<A HREF="#key-10"><CITE>11</CITE></A>].
Likewise, Windows uses BootCache, Hot File Clustering and similar
techniques to boost performance.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section What Mudur Brings-->

<H2><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mudur Brings</H2><!--SEC END -->

Mudur has been developed for Pardus, so it's probably not readily
usable for other distributions immediately. Since Mudur uses completely
rewritten service scripts, it needs a genuine modification of the
files read after init is executed. In this manner, Mudur resembles
that of initng and depinit. In this chapter, we are going to summarize
our approach, and explain why this is a better solution for startup
related speed, configurability and maintainability problems.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection High Thoughs Must Have High Language-->

<H3>High Thoughs Must Have High Language</H3><!--SEC END -->

As said by Aristophanes, 405 B.C., this great wisdom is still not
yet understood by many free software developers.<BR>
<BR>
Our main concern was not only the speed of initialization process,
but maintainability of the code base. Our previous experience with
Gentoo init system while adding internationalization support showed
that shell scripts are a maintainability nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
Why shell scripts, traditional batch processing tool of Unix, are
not suitable for this job? Answer lies in the commands used by this
scripts. Since shell scripting language doesn't have flexible and
easy to use flow control and data structures, most of these operations
are offloaded to other specialized tools like sed, awk, and in some
cases perl. One particular case of Gentoo was the env-update.sh script.
Its job was as simple as joining the values in /etc/env.d files and
generating a /etc/profile.env file. Script was using another awk script,
which in turn uses a special awk plugin module written in C.<BR>
<BR>
All those special tools with their inefficiencies and their size turns
the system into a strange Rube Goldberg contraption. So, we decided
to choose a single language, and use it everywhere in the initialization
subsystem.<BR>
<BR>
Low level languages like C or C++ are fast but also suffers from maintainability
problems. Source codes become even bigger than shell scripts, and
development time significantly increases.<BR>
<BR>
Among the high level languages, Python seemed to be the best choice,
since we already use it in many places like package build scripts,
package manager, control panel modules, and installer program YALI<SUP><A NAME="text2" HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP>. Python has small and has clean source codes. Standard library is
full of useful modules. Learning curve is easy, most of the developers
in our team picked up the language in a few days without prior experience.<BR>
<BR>
A simple boot test with init=/usr/bin/python showed that loading of
Python core and built-in modules takes 1.5-2 seconds<SUP><A NAME="text3" HREF="#note3">3</A></SUP>. From then on, only a few system tools (mount, udev, fsck, modprobe,
etc), and actual services (kdm, ssh, apache, etc) are loaded. This
is quite acceptable if you consider total time and disc IO saved.
Having Python cached in the memory also helps speeding up our other
programs.<BR>
<BR>
Current code size is around 1500 lines. Our previous (Pardus 1.0)
Gentoo based system was more than 10000 lines.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection If It's Not Broken, Don't Fix It-->

<H3>If It's Not Broken, Don't Fix It</H3><!--SEC END -->

Almost all boot time speeding up projects are obsessed with the idea
of replacing the ``init''. This is the parent of all processes.
Its primary role is to start other processes like console terminals
and actual initialization scripts as written in the file /etc/inittab.<BR>
<BR>
Since this is a very system level program, writing a replacement is
tricky and time consuming. We couldn't think a real benefit. Running
services in paralel can be done from a script, directly managing service
processes is also much easier with a little smarter /var/run/*.pid
management.<BR>
<BR>
We just set our Python script to run in /etc/inittab and work on the
real problem.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Service Scripts-->

<H3>Service Scripts</H3><!--SEC END -->

Basic jobs of initialization, i.e. loading modules, starting udev
device manager, mounting filesystems, updating system clock are handled
by a single Python script. This saves loading time and makes it simple.
These early startup jobs should run sequentally anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Other service scripts should come with their packages. Handling and
paralel running of those scripts are handled by another Pardus project
called Çomar. Çomar (COnfiguration MAnageR) is a system daemon. It
has a system model with classes and methods. Installed software packages
register their Çomar scripts (also written in Python) to the classes
on the model.<BR>
<BR>
In case of initialization system, every package which provides a service,
registers a script to the System.Service class. This class has methods
like start, stop, reload, info, etc. Configuration tools can query
this objects and control them with given methods. An access control
system makes it possible to give control of services to specific users
or groups and prevent others from accessing them.<BR>
<BR>
Main startup script runs Çomar daemon, and when called with ``default''
runlevel by init, calls System.Service.ready method on Çomar, thus
starting all services in parallel. Service scripts can call other
scripts start methods for implementing dependencies, and wait for
Çomar notification for handling restarts.<BR>
<BR>
Çomar keeps the state of services, so only services previously turned
on are started automatically.<BR>
<BR>
Çomar has many other features and classes used in Pardus system for
network management, user management, automatic configuration of graphic
subsystem, and remote management. It also has access control, profile,
remote management facilities. Those are out of scope of this document.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Limiting Resource Is IO, Not CPU-->

<H3>Limiting Resource Is IO, Not CPU</H3><!--SEC END -->

Harddisks are not necessarily slow, they can transfer data at the
rates of 20-30Mb/s, but their seek times are awful. If you read data
in a random manner, you can get quite a bad disk performance.<BR>
<BR>
It is possible to deal with this problem at the filesystem level[<A HREF="#key-15"></A>],
but deserves quite a work. Luckily, we can benefit from simpler methods.<BR>
<BR>
First thing to consider is never leaving disc IO empty. Parallellism
helps greatly here. Some operations like setting system clock from
hardware clock, pauses the system for a few seconds. You can utilize
those seconds by loading something else in the background.<BR>
<BR>
We also take a great care of not generating extra IO due to internal
machinery of startup scripts. Shell based initialization systems generally
use a lot of temporary files, and generate lots of small IO operations
themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Slowness of interpreted nature of Python is really insignificant here.
After the initial loading of Python interpreter, scripts run instantly.
Blocking happens only at calling external programs like modprobe and
fsck.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Sleep Considered Harmful-->

<H3>Sleep Considered Harmful</H3><!--SEC END -->

We have seen sleep commands in initialization systems and in many
of service scripts. This is probably due to lacking shell primitives
for properly checking the service status.<BR>
<BR>
After starting a service, there is a short time which start function
returns but service itself does not really sets its communications
ports (sockets, files, etc). Sleep statements are used to prevent
such race conditions. But this isn't a good thing to do. Setup might
take a bit longer than given time value, and if you give that value
higher, then you unnecessarily wait.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of using this unreliable method, we just wait for actual resource
(socket, file, etc), so never waste any extra time. This optimization
alone saved almost 5-6 seconds on our initialization.<BR>
<BR>
Another variant of this problem happens with udev. Device nodes under
the /dev folder are created in a random order. Ubuntu recently started
on a replacement init system[<A HREF="#key-9"><CITE>10</CITE></A>] to address this problem.
They claim that due to these issues and hotplugging, it's no longer
possible to guarantee the availability of particular devices at a
particular point in the boot process. Their new system is designed
to be event based, running scripts on certain events. We think hotplug
devices are handled and mounted much better by udev rules instead
of fstab, and that makes their rationale pretty pointless.<BR>
<BR>

Pardus initialization system is composed of following programs:<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Mudur-->

<H3>Mudur</H3><!--SEC END -->

This[<A HREF="#key-12"><CITE>14</CITE></A>] is the main package of the initialization system.
Basic script is /sbin/mudur.py which is called by /sbin/init during
the system runlevel changes, and handles basic initialization and
shutdown jobs. Another script is /sbin/muavin.py which is called by
mudur.py during the startup, and scans available hardware and loads
necessary kernel modules (coldplug). Muavin<SUP><A NAME="text4" HREF="#note4">4</A></SUP> is also called by udev on hotplug events, and handles module and
firmware loading operations. There are also a set of commands like
update-modules, update-environment, etc used by package install script,
or system admins. Those are written in Python too.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Çomar-->

<H3>Çomar</H3><!--SEC END -->

Configuration manager[<A HREF="#key-13"><CITE>15</CITE></A>] is a very small system daemon
written in C. Pardus packages register their service scripts to Çomar,
which is called by mudur.py for starting and stopping services. User
interfaces also use Çomar for managing services. Handles parallel
execution, access control, profile management and remote management.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection User Interfaces-->

<H3>User Interfaces</H3><!--SEC END -->

There is a service command which can query the status of services,
and can start/stop/restart them. There is also a KDE KControl Service
Manager module with same capabilities. Since they use Çomar for actual
operation, they are just very simple wrappers.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Service Scripts-->

<H3>Service Scripts</H3><!--SEC END -->

Scripts themselves come with the Pardus packages and managed by Çomar.
Here is a sample script for kdm:

You can't improve what you can't measure. Hopefully there is a well
known tool called bootchart[<A HREF="#key-4"><CITE>4</CITE></A>] which generates detailed
graphics. Resource utilization and process information are collected
during the boot process and are later rendered in a chart. A typical
Pardus boot sequence on a P4 2.8GHz, 1GB RAM, 80GB 5400 rpm IDE disk

We are getting very good results with file cache kernel patch[<A HREF="#key-14"><CITE>13</CITE></A>]
of Jens Axboe. Boot time is shortened only a bit, but since it can
cache not only boot process but user session as well, typical launch
time of an application like OpenOffice.org from cold start of the
computer is significantly improved without even using preloading.<BR>
<BR>
We are looking ways to integrate fcache into our boot system, and
automatically handle re-priming when cache becomes out of date with
software updates.<BR>
