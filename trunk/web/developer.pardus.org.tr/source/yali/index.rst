What is YALI ?
--------------

YALI (**Y**\et **A**\nother **L**\inux **I**\nstaller) is the first Pardus software a user encounters. Basically, it recognizes the hardware and installs Pardus software from the installation media (i.e CD) to a hard disk partition user selects. It has a high performance compared to other installers and we believe that YALI is one of the fastest graphical Linux installer on earth, thanks to PiSi package management system.

In order to install Pardus, you just need enough disk space. YALI can handle resizing of the NTFS partitions found on the disk.
