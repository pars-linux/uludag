Introduction
-------------

In this document we'll try to explain the requirements to be a Pardus developer/contributor. Although we are talking about Pardus in particular, the cited requirements in this document should apply to nearly all open source projects.

Please feel free to browse the web pages of Pardus for other information not included in this document. From those pages you may find the information needed on other documents, tools used and services. Pardus pages can be reached from `Hede <http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng>`
