<h3 id="comar">Çomar</h3>
<p>
COMAR (COnfiguration MAnageR), is a configuration framework which will function
as a middle layer between package configurations. Packages will tell the jobs
they can handle to the Çomar. They also ask the jobs or information they need
from other packages from Çomar. These jobs would be specified within the Çomar's
object model (OM) as a hierarchical class tree.
</p>
<p>
Nodes of the OM tree would be encapsulations of specific jobs which are required
for integration between the packages. For example, Desktop.Menu class would be
provided by the KDE panel application, and other packages would give their menu
entries to this object. Another example would be a Network.Transmission class
provided by local system's kernel iptables, and gateway's firewall application.
When Apache installed on such a system, both local firewall and gateway will
open the web connection (port 80) to the Apache.
</p>
<p>
Since modifying the applications themselves is hard and would tie them to
Çomar too much, we are going to use scripts written in a custom language
called Çomar Scripting Language (CSL). These scripts will come with the
package and provide the Çomar objects. Upon a call from Çomar, they'll
handle modifying package's configuration files according to the request,
sending signals to the application or restarting it when necessary.
</p>
<p>
There would be a Çomar daemon for keeping track of the requests, handling
atomicity of transactions, retrying them when they failed for temporary
problems. It will also make it easy to implement remote objects, and
Access Control Lists (ACLs) over local and remote objects.
</p>

<h3 id="pisi">Pisi</h3>
<p>
PISI (Packages Installed Succesfully as Intented) is our package management
system. It will handle installing and removing packages from network or
installation media. Pisi will be based on Çomar. Dependencies could be either
packages/libraries or Çomar classes. It is also possible to request a package
by classes it provides. Thus a user will be able to install a program for
handling a MIME type or serving emails without knowing the names of required
package names.
</p>

<h3 id="yali">Yalı</h3>
<p>
YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer) is our installer. It will install the
base system and user's selection of packages to an install target and recover
useful information like emails, bookmarks, etc from previous installed system
wherever possible.
</p>

<h3 id="paketler">Packages</h3>
<p>
A "package" is a file that is formed in order application software to be
independently and easily added to and removed from the system. Packages
Project is responsible for determining the packages that Uludag will include,
and forming the packages from the source code and in line with Uludag's goals.
