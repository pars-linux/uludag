Uludag, is also the name of a mountain 150 km to south-east of Istanbul and 350 km to west of Ankara, which is infamous for its ski resorts.

      <para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Is Uludag different than Linux?</title>
      <para>
        Linux, is the kernel of the operating system. A Linux distribution gathers the kernel, tools and application software from varied sources, provides interoperability to this collection and exposes a common management framework. The distribution relieves an ordinary user from acquiring the kernel and all the tools individually and to spend time and effort to make them operate together flawlessly. Uludag is a Linux distribution, thus uses the Linux kernel and several related tools. The value add is the easy installation and use of the resulting operating system.
      </para>
    </sect1>

      <title>When will Uludag be released?</title>

        The fully fledged operating system is planned to be released by the end of 2004. Nevertheless, being an open source project, trial versions, software, and design documents will be available through the web site. In addition, we foresee that Uludag will be deployed in different projects prior to the official release.

    <sect1>
      <title>What does open source mean? What is GPL?</title>
      <para>
