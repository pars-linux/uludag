<!--CUT DEF section 1 --><H1>Python in Pardus</H1><H3>A.Murat Eren, Barış Metin, Gürer Özen</H3>
<!--TOC section Introduction-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc1">1</A> Introduction</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can
be used for many kinds of software development. At least, that it
what its homepage says. It is actually used by a range of companies
from Google to Firaxis Games[<A HREF="#key-6"><CITE>1</CITE></A>] in many different areas.
Some Linux distributions use it for developing their tools, mostly
user interfaces.</P><P>It is used almost everywhere in Pardus. From startup system to user
interfaces. This wasn't intentional. We started using Python in a
few places for rapid development, and then it spread to other areas.
Also most of the core developers learned Python, after joining the
project.</P><P>In this report, we are giving a summary of our Python experience,
how it is used in Pardus GNU/Linux distribution, and what sort of
problems encountered.</P><!--TOC section Package Management-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc2">2</A> Package Management</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Package management is the key part of a software distribution. Users
expect it to work robustly and automatically. Packagers want to package
their software without going through complex build procedures. Developers
want to quickly deploy their patches to the users. Distribution maintainers
want automated tools for validating, analyzing and building the software
collection. Finally third parties want to embed and extend core distribution
into their own specialized releases.</P><P>Our custom package management system PiSi is designed to meet those
requirements. Here we are going to discuss involvement of the Python.
You can find more information about general design in the PiSi article[<A HREF="#key-5"><CITE>2</CITE></A>].</P><!--TOC subsection Package Specification-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Package Specification</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Package is a collection of files and some meta information about what
the contained software is, how it is going to be installed, and what
it's requirements are (dependencies). A binary package is usually
build from a specification which describes the original source, patches
added by the distribution, and build instructions. We keep those specifications
inside a subversion repository, one directory per package, neatly
organized in the component directories.</P><P>Since specification contains both data (like software name, its homepage,
version, description, license, location of the original source, list
of the patches, etc) and programs (build instructions, install instructions,
remove instructions, etc), we decided to keep those separate. That
way, parsing and using the data becomes really easy.</P><P>Avoiding new ad-hoc formats, and keeping everything simple as it can
be, we decided to put data into an XML file. Data is very structured,
and some items (like description) have translated versions as well,
so everything fits nicely in the XML format.</P><P>Deciding about programs was harder. Ideally all programs (build, install,
remove scripts) should be written in same language. Packager only
has to know one language, and maintenance becomes a lot easier.</P><P>Traditionally build scripts were shell scripts. Shell is ideal for
simple tasks requiring batch run of a series of commands. Unfortunately
there are cases where you need conditional operations, do string processing,
and iterate an operation over a series of data. In those cases shell
syntax becomes awkward, debugging and maintenance costs go higher.</P><P>In simplest case of build operation (configure; make), there isn't
much difference between alternative languages. But when cases get
more complex, you'll definitely want a language with rich set of datatypes,
native support for strings, clean and concise syntax, and a standart
library with a wide range of useful functions. This language shouldn't
have a steep learning curve, and shouldn't look too different from
shell scripts or shouldn't require a complete paradigm change for
system admins and packagers (like some pure functional languages).</P><P>We decided that Python successfully meets these requirements, and
is the best choice for package scripts.</P><!--TOC subsection Build Scripts-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Build Scripts</H3><!--SEC END --><P>After coding a proof of concept package manager, we started making
packages. In a six months of time, with a six people, we managed to
make packages of base system (kernel, drivers, glibc, gcc, gnu tools),
desktop (xorg, KDE), and applications (Gimp, TeT<sub>E</sub>X, K3B, mplayer,
OpenOffice.org, etc). There were a total of 600 packages which are
bootstrapped and build on a Pardus system. Now a year after, we have
1227 packages in our official repository[<A HREF="#key-19"><CITE>3</CITE></A>], and 698 packages
in an extra contribution repository[<A HREF="#key-20"><CITE>4</CITE></A>], made by 25 developers.</P><P>In the official repository, there are 32641 lines (where 8044 of them
are comment lines) of Python code for packages. Script for one of
the simple packages, gparted, is given below:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autotools.install()&nbsp;
</TT></DL></DIV>


<P>
As you see, there isn't much in this script, everything is handled
by the autotools module. A generic utility module and a few such build
system modules (for autotools, scons, cmake, perl and python extensions)
are provided by package manager (in the pisi.actionsapi package).
Stages of the build process are represented by three Python functions.</P><P>Here is another slightly complex example function from the LyX
package:</P>

<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autotools.configure("--with-frontend=qt")
</TT></DL></DIV>

<P>
As you see, some defaults are modified via environment variables before
configuring.</P><P>There aren't many complex build scripts. Most of the logic and error
checking is handled by provided utility modules (ActionsAPI). Scripts
requiring complex operations and interactions are managed by our configuration
management system Comar. PiSi merely passes those scripts to the Comar.
Examples of them are given in the system configuration section of
this article.</P><!--TOC subsection Package Manager-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Package Manager</H3><!--SEC END --><P>PiSi itself is written in Python too. This is a huge deviation from
other well known package management software (Redhat's rpm or Debian's
dpkg which are both written in C).</P><P>PiSi architecture is quite different from traditional designs. Every
functionality, related to the package management like installing,
building, fetching, dependency solving, repository management, validating
is included in the core (compare with dpkg, apt-get or rpm, urpmi
separation). PiSi can work with both binary repositories, and source
packages like Gentoo's portage. On the other hand, package configuration
(like calling ldconfig, modifying global configuration files, etc)
is delegated to Comar.</P><P>PiSi source[<A HREF="#key-21"><CITE>5</CITE></A>] is 14245 lines of Python code distributed
in 72 modules in 6 packages. Command line driver (pisi command) is
just a simple front-end to all those modules. They can also be used
together or partially by other programs. There are also a few more
scripts, and a comprehensive test suite containing both unit tests,
and full scenario tests.</P><P>An example test scenario (scenarios/bug3481scen.py in PiSi source)
is like this:</P>

</TT></DL></DIV>


<P>
It is as readable as pseudo code, yet it works too.</P><P>A package management software deals a lot with sets, lists, and dependency
graphs. Python has former two natively, and implementing latter is
very simple with available primitives. Object oriented nature of Python,
with module and package concepts, kept the code very modular and good
structured. We have used functional operators (map, filter, reduce)
and list comprehensions a lot. Even metaclasses are used in a few
places.</P><P>Here is an example from the diff package (they are for updating a
package with minimal network data transfer) generating code:</P>

<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
files_all&nbsp;=&nbsp;set(map(lambda&nbsp;x:(x.path,&nbsp;x.hash),&nbsp;files.list))&nbsp;<BR>
files_old&nbsp;=&nbsp;set(map(lambda&nbsp;x:(x.path,&nbsp;x.hash),&nbsp;oldfiles.list))&nbsp;<BR>
files_delta&nbsp;=&nbsp;files_all&nbsp;-&nbsp;files_old
</TT></DL></DIV>


<P>
From two file lists of the old and new packages, changed file list
is extracted with maximum simplicity and clarity.</P><P>An other reason to choose Python was its standard library. Although
some parts of it (xml modules) are extremely slow and hard to use,
and some parts (os, shutil, zipfile) needs a few wrappers to get it
right, we have used quite a number of standart modules (like cPickle,
re, unittest, subprocess, getopt, gettext, zlib, bz2, tarfile, urllib2,
urlparse, sha). More information about our problems with the standard
library can be found in problems section of this article. But all
in all, they helped greatly by allowing us to reuse already tested
components instead of writing everything from scratch.</P><P>We have only encountered a speed problem with XML parsing, which we
solved by first migrating to 4suite parser, then our custom module.
Currently there is a slowness only within certain database operations,
but that is mostly caused by suboptimal use of BerkeleyDB, and will
be fixed in the next major release. Most of the PiSi work is bounded
by disc IO, and heavy calculation parts like dependency solving work
really fast, if carefully coded by using as much as built-in functions
of the Python.</P><P>A reason to code in C could be that you can statically compile everything
into an executable, and run that even if every library in the system
is broken. That is a trade-off, we decided to make. Currently PiSi
depends on a minimal Python installation (with its library, and a
few of modules), BerkeleyDB, piksemel (our XML python module) and
glibc. Since those packages are required for operation, PiSi takes
extra care while updating them.</P><!--TOC subsection User Interfaces-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->User Interfaces</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Main desktop environment of the Pardus is KDE. Python bindings[<A HREF="#key-22"><CITE>6</CITE></A>]
of the KDE are highly maintained and very comprehensive. Every component
of the desktop, be it an application, a control center module, an
IO handler module, or a panel applet, can be written in Python. Similarly
you can use almost any component like khtml from Python.</P><P>Graphical user interface of the PiSi is 2558 lines of Python code.
This includes both a control center module, and a panel applet for
regularly checking repositories and showing available updates.</P>
<img src="http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/pisi/package-manager.png" alt="pisi user interface">

<P>Another application using PiSi is Pardusman, a tool for making release
media. You can select packages from a binary repository and easily
make a live or install CD with a few clicks. It is 1481 lines of Python
code.</P><P>As you see, PiSi user interfaces are very short, yet quite capable
programs. Coding in Python saves quite a bit of boiler plate code
when compared to C++. Subclassing a window is just a <TT>class
MyWindow(QMainWindow)</TT> line for example.</P><!--TOC section System Configuration-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc3">3</A> System Configuration</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Configuring software and hardware is the most boring task, a user
can do with a computer. Installing a program can require setting up
some system variables. If you want to connect to the Internet, you
have to set up some options of the network interface device, maybe
even run some programs to handle the connection. Your hardware needs
some kernel modules loaded, and some programs run to start operating.
You may need to edit your xorg.conf file to be able to use native
resolution of your LCD.</P><P>Hopefully most of these tasks can be automated, and other can be greatly
simplified.</P><P>Our configuration framework Comar is designed to do that. Explaining
all the details needs a separate article. We are going to layout only
the general architecture here. So, basically,</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Configuration tasks are defined in a system model, grouped by classes
which contain related tasks.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Each software package can carry small configuration scripts for these
classes.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">A class can be provided by different packages, also a package can
provide different classes.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">When you call a configuration task, configuration script drives the
package to do this job, by modifying its configuration file, sending
signals, calling commands or using whatever mechanism is necessary.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">You can ask a task from a specific package, anyone who can do that
job, or everyone providing that class.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">There is a daemon who keeps registered classes, listens for configuration
calls, and runs the scripts.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">This daemon handles access control, so you can delegate some configuration
permissions to normal users.
</LI></UL><P>
This architecture has quite a number of advantages. What we are interested
here is that the actual logic of the configuration tasks are carried
within package scripts. That way, packages are well encapsulated,
different versions can have different ways of doing same tasks.</P><P>Theoretically these scripts could be in any language. But there are
many practical problems with that. Maintenance becomes harder with
a big repository with scripts written in all sorts of languages. Function
calling and parameter passing needs to be implemented for all those
languages.</P><P>Since we already used Python in build scripts, also using it in configuration
scripts came up as a natural choice. Several advantages are,</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Packagers need to know only one language,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Comprehensive standard library with a wide range of extensions is
available to use in scripts,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Every feature of the Python is accessible and controllable from the
Python C library,
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Scripts can be called by all users. They must have permission to make
the call beforehand, but since script itself runs with a higher privilege,
an interpreted language with garbage collection is very helpful against
buffer overflow type attacks caused by malformed parameters from users.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Comar daemon[<A HREF="#key-23"><CITE>7</CITE></A>] listens configuration requests and, if
user has permission to do that, forks a job process for each call.
This job process loads up package script and run it. That way configuration
operations can run in parallel, and self contained.
</LI></UL><P>
We first tried to write this daemon in Python too, but changed to
C later. Reason is that daemon is very small (6216 lines of C code)
and very low level, there isn't much to gain from Python. Since Python
interpreter is not even initialized in main process, resource usage
is very low when there isn't a configuration job is running.</P><P>There are some common operations among the Comar scripts which are
not covered by the standard library. These functions and a binding
class for making Comar calls is included in a Python package. Here
is an example using that Python binding:</P>

<DIV ALIGN=left><DL COMPACT=compact><DT><DD><TT>
import&nbsp;comar&nbsp;<BR>
link&nbsp;=&nbsp;comar.Link()&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
#&nbsp;Set&nbsp;some&nbsp;address&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;network&nbsp;connection&nbsp;<BR>
link.Net.Link.setAddress(name="Home&nbsp;Network",&nbsp;address="192.168.3.165",&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gateway="192.168.3.1")&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
#&nbsp;Query&nbsp;all&nbsp;system&nbsp;services&nbsp;<BR>
link.System.Service.info()&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>

reply&nbsp;=&nbsp;link.read_cmd()&nbsp;<BR>
print&nbsp;reply.script,&nbsp;reply.data
</TT></DL></DIV>


<P>
These calls and their results are transferred to and from the Comar
via a Unix socket internally.</P><P>In the current release of Pardus, package installation, system startup,
display configuration, network and firewall configuration, user management,
time and settings are all carried to the Comar. Scripts and graphical
user interfaces are coded and running. More subsystems like power
management and storage management are in progress. A few examples
of current usage is given below.</P><!--TOC subsection Boot Subsystem-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Boot Subsystem</H3><!--SEC END --><P>There is a separate article[<A HREF="#key-24"><CITE>8</CITE></A>] on our boot subsystem (called
Mudur, means director in Turkish). We are going to give a summary
of Python related features here.</P><P>System is made of a single Python script which handles basic initialization
(starting udev, mounting filesystems, etc), and a System.Service Comar
class with methods like start, stop, info, etc. Services are controlled
by their Comar scripts. There are also a few tools (update-modules,
update-environment, etc) rewritten in Python. Another Python agent
deals with loading kernel modules and firmware for hardware, for both
coldplugging and hotplugging.</P><P>In total of 2345 lines, Mudur makes Pardus, one of the fastest (in
most configurations KDM login screen comes in 15-20 seconds) booting
operating systems, with a highly maintainable, completely and easily
localizable boot subsystem.</P>

<img src="./sm.png" alt="service manager">

<!--TOC subsection Network Subsystem-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Network Subsystem</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Basic class of the network system is Net.Link which defines a way
(ethernet cable, wireless, ppp, vpn, etc) to connect a network. For
an example, link.py script[<A HREF="#key-7"><CITE>9</CITE></A>] from wireless-tools package
implements wireless connection with manual or automatic network configuration,
WEP and WPA encryption, scanning, automatic detection of devices,
and other basic functionality in 489 lines of Python code.</P><P>This is because most of the actual functionality is already implemented
by tools like iwconfig, iwlist, dhcpcd, wpa_supplicant, etc. We just
need to configure and use them according to user's wishes. This is
very easy with Python, you can just import dbus, and for example talk
to the WPA service with a few lines, unlike a C or shell based implementation.</P><P>User interfaces can use this link providers in a highly generic way
without caring about implementation details, since this is done over
the Comar service, fine grained access permissions can be given to
users.</P><P>There are other classes for firewall and name service configuration.</P><P>Graphical user interface itself is 2450 lines of Python code, including
a panel applet.</P>

<img src="./nm.png" alt="network manager main ui"> <img src="./nm2.png" alt="network manager wireless profile">

<!--TOC subsection Other Examples-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Other Examples</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Naturally package configuration is done with Comar too. Each package
can provide a setup script with postInstall and preRemove methods.
Additionally some packages would register their scripts on another
class for operating on other packages' install and removal. That way,
you can write scripts for operating on special kind of packages or
files, like fonts, kernel modules, libraries, etc. Packages can inspect
and register their plugins without providing each one with a script.</P>

<P>User management is another aspect handled by Comar.</P>
<img src="http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/images/user-manager-en-1.png" alt="user manager"> <img src="http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/images/user-manager-en-2.png" alt="user manager">


<P>Pardus is able to detect native panel size for most of the LCD monitors,
and has a very good Xorg auto-configuration system[<A HREF="#key-15"><CITE>10</CITE></A>] called
&#X201C;zorg&#X201D;. A task-based user interface for controlling important
aspects, and especially multi-monitor situations is under development.</P><P>We are developing an enterprise management system for controlling
a network of computers. It is going to take global configuration policies
from an LDAP server, and apply to the local system with Comar framework.
Thus Comar will slowly cover all areas of the system configuration
in the future.</P><!--TOC section Applications and Scripts-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc4">4</A> Applications and Scripts</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Our installation program YALI[<A HREF="#key-8"><CITE>11</CITE></A>] is composed of 7521 line
of Python code. Although it basically uses PiSi and Comar for installation,
there are many hardware related modules, like a partition manager
which contributes to the size. GUI code is also a bit big, because
installation environment only has Qt widgets running on a bare X Window
server.</P>
<img src="http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/images/yali-en-4.jpg" alt="pardus installer">
<P>There is a KControl replacement we wrote, which uses both KDE control

out package descriptions from subversion repository, finds new releases,
builds them, builds the other packages requiring recompile, sends
packaged binaries to the file server. We are looking for a web based
interface for the build farm, probably based on Django.</P><P>There several small scripts, validating the integrity of package repositories,
generating web pages for packages, and countless smaller scripts for

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc5">5</A> Custom Modules</H2><!--SEC END --><P>In the process of Pardus development, we have encountered some common
problems, and wrote some generic modules[<A HREF="#key-10"><CITE>13</CITE></A>] to deal with
them.</P><!--TOC subsection piksemel-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->piksemel</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Unfortunately XML module of the standard Python library is too slow
for serious usage. Parsing the package content information of the
TeT<sub>E</sub>X PiSi package (a 2.137.893 bytes XML file), for example, takes
almost two seconds on a 1.66 GHz dual core Intel processor. Another
problem is the API is cumbersome to use, and quite un-Pythonic.</P><P>We first switched to 4suite package, and gained quite a bit of speed.
Then wrote our own module based on iksemel library. It is very small
(designed mainly for embedded systems), and much faster than other
parsers. Python API we add around it is designed to be easy to use
and more Pythonic.</P><P>Simple parsing example:</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->catbox</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Sandbox is a mechanism which provides a tightly-controlled set of
resources for guest programs to run in. They are used in build systems
for, constraining packages to the temporary build directory, keeping

similar purposes.</P><P>There are two feasible ways to build such a sandbox. Intercepting
glibc function calls with LD_PRELOAD, or Linux system calls with
ptrace. Former way makes it difficult to implement interaction between
PiSi and build script (both are Python programs).</P><P>There is already a good ptrace sandbox framework for Python, called
Subterfugue. Apart from a small C binding for ptrace call, it is completely
written in Python. Unfortunately dealing with each system call with
Python is quite slow for a build farm. There are over a thousand packages,
and some of them like OpenOffice.org or kdebase takes a huge time
to compile even on high end computers.</P><P>Thus we wrote catbox, a small sandboxing C module for PiSi.</P><!--TOC subsection pyaspects-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->pyaspects</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Like all others Pardus installation program uses a wizard based installation
routine, changing screens back and forth. We wanted to use the advantages
of aspect-oriented programming methodology to deal with the cross-cutting
concerns in these screen switchings. That is how PyAspects started
its life first as a package in YALI and became a separate module later
on. Basically PyAspects is a collection of modules to ease aspect-oriented
programming in Python language.</P><P>Simple weaver:</P>

<!--TOC section Problems-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc6">6</A> Problems</H2><!--SEC END --><P>We have encountered several problems with some parts of the standard
library. Since we deal with all sorts of weird tar archives during
the build, corner case errors in tarfile module emerged quickly[<A HREF="#key-1"><CITE>14</CITE></A>].
Another related problem is in zipfile module. Since there is no way
to incrementally extract files from zip archives (pisi packages are
zip archives), extracting big files (like install.tar.lzma of OpenOffice.org)
causes too much memory usage. We fixed that with a hacky insertion
of another read() variant into the ZipFile class.</P><P>As said before, performance and usage problems of xml.dom API forced
us to use a custom parser module for those operations.</P><P>There are also many smaller errors encountered during the development,
which a few of them[<A HREF="#key-2"><CITE>15</CITE></A>] reported/patched by us, and others
got fixed by other parties along the normal Python development process.</P><P>Python's insistence of using the ASCII encoding caused some annoyance,
since we use UTF8 everywhere, and our main locale (tr_TR.UTF8) have
some characters outside of ISO Latin 1.</P><P>We have started with 2.3 release, and moved on to 2.4 before Pardus
2007. Now we are getting ready for the Python 2.5 series. API/ABI
breaking changes caused some minor work, but they are generally well
documented, so never got out of control.</P><!--TOC section Conclusion-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc7">7</A> Conclusion</H2><!--SEC END --><P>We have created a whole new distribution with custom package and configuration
management tools from scratch in almost two years. We didn't have
the know-how of making a distribution when we started, so development
time can be considered very fast.</P><P>Once we finished the design processes, we quickly build prototypes
of the tools and started using them. We even made a few throwaway
versions the examine some design decisions. Rapid development nature
and quick refactoring capabilities of the Python helped us greatly.</P><P>Core developers learned it in a few days, outside developers/packagers,
even the users are very quick to learn our tools. Learning curve of
the Python is very smooth. You can start using it like basic, then
move on to next levels by learning the object oriented and functional
paradigms.</P><P>Even with the problems mentioned in the above chapters, standard library
is great, and many important environments like Qt and KDE have excellent
Python bindings.</P><P>We are not only happy with our choice, but looking forward to use
high level languages in more places.</P><!--TOC section References-->
