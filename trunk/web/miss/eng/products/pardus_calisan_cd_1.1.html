                        <span class="baslik">Before To Start Working With Pardus</span> <br> 
                        <br> 
                        For opening your computer with Pardus, putting the Pardus Live CD to your CD-ROM Drive and restarting the computer is sufficent. <br> 
                        <br> 
                        At this time if your computer starts with operating system which was on your hard disc, normally this shows that you can't set your BIOS or you can't write the CD correctly. <br> 
                        <br> 
                        At this situation you should set your BIOS for starting from CD-ROM drive. For this in your mainboard's BIOS starting up settings, CD-ROM drive must be chosen as first. On the other hand, laptop users may need to select starting up devices via special key combinations which is determined by producers. If you tried but couldn't prosper or if you don't know how to do, you can get information from your mainboard's manual. <br> 
                        <br> 
                        <span class="baslik">Starting Pardus</span> <br> 
                        <br> 
                        After your computer begin starting up with Pardus in the CD-ROM drive, you will see a manu which contains choices that you can move with direction keys and select with enter key:<br> 
                        <br> 
                        <ul> 
                          <li>Pardus Linux </li> 
                          <li>Pardus Linux (HT or minimum 2 CPU systems) </li> 
                          <li>Pardus Linux (minimum settings [vesa=standart]) </li> 
                          <li>Pardus Linux (minimum settings [acpi=off, apm=off, vesa=standart]) </li> 
                        </ul> 
                        First choice is default and probably suitable for you. Second choice is which have more than one cpu. Third or fourth choices are for old computers or laptops which may have some problems and for some desktop systems. When you select one of these choices, Linux Kernel begin to be loaded to your memory. After a while you will see a progress bar, which shows that how much part of process have done, with green coloured Pardus screen. If your monitor gets dark and there is no signal for a long time, you should restart your computer with RESET button and choose 3rd or 4th choices from the menu. Although you try all choices, your computer can not be started up with Pardus because of hardware problems.<br> 
                        <br> 
                        At the last part of starting, green coloured Pardus screen shuts down and desktop environment begin to start up.
