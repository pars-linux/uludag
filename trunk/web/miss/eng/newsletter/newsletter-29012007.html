Welcome to Pardus Newsletter, Issue #1 which covers the last two weeks. In
this issue, we cover the Pardus 2007 release, fixed bugs, new packages,
Pardus in the media, and much more!

<p>

<p><span class="baslik">Breaking news</span><p>

After the release of our new, innovative Pardus 2007, there has been many reviews in the Linux media. 
Distrowatch says: "Pardus Linux is not only a remarkable distribution, it is also one of the most unexpected surprise packages of 2006". Linux.com had 
a very positive review of Pardus 2007, mentioning it's one of the easiest Linux distributions to run and manage. Other 
<a href=http://www.quebecos.com/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=49>reviews</a> have <a href=http://beranger.org/index.php?isgold=1&offset=0>hit the streets</a>, 
also. We expect to see more constructive reviews as there's always room for improvement for future Pardus releases. 

<p><span class="baslik">Meetings and events</span><p>

Pardus developers will have a meeting in Istanbul, Turkey on 4 February,
2007. The meeting will take place in TUBITAK between 10:00 - 16:00. The
schedule is not defined yet, however most of the discussions are foreseen
to be focused on quality, usability, package management, development
issues and localization. There'll be a shuttle which will pick developers
and interested parties from Mecidiyeköy and Kadıköy.

<p><span class="baslik">Featured application</span><p>

There are many repositories for Pardus, but are you fed up with not
knowing which package is in which repository? With pisibul you can
perform fast and efficient searches among all source packages.
This software can also update itself automatically by downloading 
latest database of packages in source repositories.
<p>
Check out pisibul and <a href=http://pisibul.sourceforge.net/en.html>try it for yourself</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">News from forums</span><p>

If you think that Pardus lacks a good forum ecosystem, think twice. There are two 
active forums: one is on <a href=http://worldforum.pardus-linux.nl>Dutch Pardus Linux</a> web page, 
and the other on pardus-forum.org.
Lately the discussions have focused on the package manager, installation scenarios, 
<a href=http://worldforum.pardus-linux.nl/viewtopic.php?p=1568#1568>installing applications</a> and "<a 
href=http://worldforum.pardus-linux.nl/viewtopic.php?t=66>how I switched to Pardus since I love it</a>" type of
submissions from <a href=http://worldforum.pardus-linux.nl/viewtopic.php?t=138>happy users</a>.

<p>
Moreover, <a href=http://www.pardus.it>Italian Pardus Linux</a> web page has switched to Wordpress 2.1. 
We expect to see more news in Italian, bumping Italian speaking Pardus users!

<p><span class="baslik">Developer's Arena</span><p>

There has been some progress on the PISI package management system. Our PISI maintainer Faik 
is working on a "delta" model which will enable to download only the different parts of a
binary package in order to update a system. This way, users will not have to download, i.e 100 Mb
for the whole OpenOffic.org package, but only, say, 2 Mb. More on this later.
<p>
Pardus is one of the fastest responsing Linux distributions to security
concerns and announcements, thanks to İsmail (the security head) and Ekin (our test wizard).
There will be a bunch of updates as of 29 January, together with <a href=http://www.kde.org>KDE 3.5.6 packages</a>. 
Pardus users are encouraged to update their system via <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/package-manager>Package Manager</a>.

<p><span class="baslik">New packages</span><p>

Second Life is a 3-D virtual world entirely built and owned by its residents. The same day Second Life client is announced as open source, 
we have <a href=http://www.pardus.org.tr/~ismail/tmp/secondlife-1.13.2.12-1.pisi>packaged it for you</a>. Needless to say, it requires 
a 3D graphics card (i.e ATI, Nvidia, etc). and a fast system.
