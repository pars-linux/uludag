</span>


<p class="icmetin">
The purpose of Pardus weekly builds (a.k.a WeekEnds) is to allow developers have
the opportunity to see the development status of Pardus Linux. Our
distribution has sometimes get criticisms about the short period of time
between releases. One day, we sat down and concluded to have weekly
builds with the help of Pardusman. So, Pardus weely builds (WeekEnd)
has come out from this idea. The name -WeekEnd- is chosen, since the builds
usually show up on Thursday or Friday, to play with them at the weekend.
This nice piece of software can be used by anyone: It just asks for the
PISI database index file, downloads it, and fetches the PISI packages
according to the selection criteria. With this tool, you have produce
a CD, DVD or even a flash disk, be it 200 Mb or 3 GB in size.
<p class="icmetin">
Note that these builds do show the development status of Pardus, that
means they are not tested, and not installed on a variety of hardware.
Running it means that you may ruin your data, configuration files, e-mails
and even all files on your disk. However, we greatly encourage you to
install a WeekEnd on one of your spare machines and give feedback to
<a href=http://bugs.pardus.org.tr>Pardus Bugzilla</a> accordingly.

<p class="icmetin">
The excitement in this process is that, you'll know all the development
progress Pardus Linux will encounter. You'll have access to the latest software
and/or technology Pardus brings. This is a good opportunity since you can
easily test the unknown, provide feedback and even make amendments in
the project lifecycle.

</span>

<p class="icmetin">
Every week, in order to have a stable Pardus, our weekly builds appear
on Pardus servers for testing. WeekEnds can be downloaded from 
<a href=ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/pardus/haftalik>Pardus FTP site</a>. The burning process is the same as a normal CD ISO: Just
download it, burn it to a CD-ROM using Nero (Windows) or K3b.
