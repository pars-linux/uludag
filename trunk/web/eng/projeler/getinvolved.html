<h1>How can you help? </h1>

<br><br>

Pardus is different from other distributions: it's a community driven
Linux distribution developed by open minded people. We find real solutions
to real problems. Our own package manager, hardware configurator, 
Python based init system, configuration manager etc all make Pardus
a unique distribution.

<br><br>

Pardus developers believe in the community involvement, so all the 
discussions take place transparently. Now Pardus project is looking for
volunteers to foster its innovative work.
Whether you are a developer, translator, quality manager or bugfixer,
we have an open seat in our plane. Join Pardus team today.
