===========================
Bugs.py, also called BugSPY
===========================

BugSPY is a library and a tool for managing Pardus bugzilla. We cannot use
other bugzilla tools as we use additional/different types of flags. With this
tool, we will be able to create bugs, comment on them, and close them.

BugSPY uses mechanize_ library which emulates a browser inside python library.
Mechanize is easy-to-use tool, it handles cookies, forms, etc., everything you
expect from a browser. I used it because sending raw POST queries to bugzilla
is painful. Just go around the code and see form stuff, easy to use and clean,
yummy!
