This script was taken from Gentoo to minize the work in Pardus Security. Not much has been changed from original code.

Bugzilla code was changed to enter bugs on Pardus bugzilla. After bug is entered, the INI entry for this bug is added to relevant tracker files (tracker.2009.ini, tracker.2008.ini, tracker.corporate.ini).
