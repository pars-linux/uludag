We currently use a subset of the format used by Debian.

Each entry looks like this:

id description
	UPCASE: text

where

id
	CVE-YYYY-nnnn
description
	Pretty much freeform description of the problem. Short and optional.
	By convention, if it's taken from upstream data source
	automatically, it will be in parens.  If you want to use a different
	description, put it in square brackets instead.
UPCASE
	Any word in upper case, typically BUG, NOTE, HELP, TODO, RESERVED,
	REJECTED, NOT-FOR-US
	May be repeated for each entry.
