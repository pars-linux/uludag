- Pratical part of tests
    If the service openssh was not start, start it from service manager


    - For Limited content serving:
        - Disable limited content serving
            - Try to make a remote connection from an other computer to your computer.
                If you have a static ip you can use it for remote connection

            Type console
            # ssh <your_computer_name>@<static_ip>
            Observe that the connection accepted.

        - Try to add a well known port and enable limited content serving.
            Open the related service of this port from service-manager.

            - Try to make a remote connection from an other computer to your computer.
                # ssh <your_computer_name>@<static_ip>
                Observe that the connection refused.

            - Try to make a remote connection using the added port from an other computer to your computer.
                # ssh -p <port> <your_computer_name>@<static_ip>
                Observe that the connection is accepted.

    - For internet sharing:
        - Plug an external ethernet or internal ethernet card to your computer. And plug an ethernet cable between your computer and an other. ( And if the other computer have an internet acces please stop it. )

        - Choose the first ethernet card for gate to internet, and the second for gate to home network.
            Now try to connect to internet over your computer.

    - For access restriction:
        - Disable access restriction
            - Try to make a remote connection with using a well known port from your computer to an other remote computer.
                If the remote computer has a static ip you can use it for remote connection

                Type console
                # ssh -p <port> <remote_computer_name>@<static_ip>
                Observe that the connection accepted.

        - Try to add a well known port and enable access restriction.
            - Try to make a remote connection using added port from your  computer to an other computer.
