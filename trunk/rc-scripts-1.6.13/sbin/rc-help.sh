${GREEN}Pardus RC-Scripts; ${BLUE}http://www.uludag.org.tr/${OFF}

Usage: ${CYAN}${myservice}${OFF} < ${GREEN}flags${OFF} > [ ${GREEN}options${OFF} ]

${CYAN}Options:${OFF}
    ${GREEN}start${OFF}
      Start service, as well as the services it depends on (if not already
      started).

    ${GREEN}stop${OFF}
      Stop service, as well as the services that depend on it (if not already
      stopped).

    ${GREEN}restart${OFF}
      Restart service, as well as the services that depend on it.

      Note to developers:  If this function is replaced with a custom one,
      'svc_start' and 'svc_stop' should be used instead of 'start' and
      'stop' to restart the service.  This is so that the dependencies
      can be handled correctly.  Refer to the portmap rc-script for an
      example.

    ${GREEN}pause${OFF}
      Same as 'stop', but the services that depends on it, will not be
      stopped.  This is useful for stopping a network interface without
      stopping all the network services that depend on 'net'.

    ${GREEN}zap${OFF}
      Reset a service that is currently stopped, but still marked as started,
      to the stopped state.  Basically for killing zombie services.

    ${GREEN}status${OFF}
      Prints \"status:  started\" if the service is running, else it
      prints \"status:  stopped\".

      Note that if the '--quiet' flag is given, it will return true if the
      service is running, else false.

    ${GREEN}ineed|iuse${OFF}
      List the services this one depends on.  Consult the section about
      dependencies for more info on the different types of dependencies.

    ${GREEN}needsme|usesme${OFF}
      List the services that depend on this one.  Consult the section about
      dependencies for more info on the different types of dependencies.

    ${GREEN}broken${OFF}
      List the missing or broken dependencies of type 'need' this service
      depends on.

${CYAN}Flags:${OFF}
    ${GREEN}--quiet${OFF}
      Suppress output to stdout, except if:

      1) It is a warning, then output to stdout
      2) It is an error, then output to stderr

    ${GREEN}--nocolor${OFF}
      Suppress the use of colors.

${CYAN}Dependencies:${OFF}
    This is the heart of the Pardus RC-Scripts, as it determines the order
    in which services gets started, and also to some extend what services
    get started in the first place.

    The following example demonstrates how to use dependencies in
    rc-scripts:

    depend() {
        need foo bar
        use ray
    }

    Here we have foo and bar as dependencies of type 'need', and ray of
    type 'use'.  You can have as many dependencies of each type as needed, as
    long as there is only one entry for each type, listing all its dependencies
    on one line only.

    ${GREEN}need${OFF}
      These are all the services needed for this service to start.  If any service
      in the 'need' line is not started, it will be started even if it is not
      in the current, or 'boot' runlevel, and then this service will be started.
      If any services in the 'need' line fails to start or is missing, this
      service will never be started.

    ${GREEN}use${OFF}
      This can be seen as representing optional services this service depends on
      that are not critical for it to start.  For any service in the 'use' line,
      it must be added to the 'boot' or current runlevel to be considered a valid
      'use' dependency.  It can also be used to determine startup order.

    ${GREEN}before${OFF}
      This, together with the 'after' dependency type, can be used to control
      startup order.  In core, 'before' and 'after' do not denote a dependency,
      but should be used for order changes that will only be honoured during
      a change of runlevel.  All services listed will get started *after* the
      current service.  In other words, this service will get started *before*
      all listed services.

    ${GREEN}after${OFF}
      All services listed will be started *before* the current service.  Have a
      look at 'before' for more info.

    ${GREEN}provide${OFF}
      This is not really a dependency type, rather it will enable you to create
      virtual services.  This is useful if there is more than one version of
      a specific service type, system loggers or crons for instance.  Just
      have each system logger provide 'logger', and make all services in need
      of a system logger depend on 'logger'.  This should make things much more
      generic.

    ${GREEN}parallel${OFF}
      This is not really a dependency type, but enable you to specify if a
      service can start in parallel or not.  It takes one of two arguments,
      either 'yes' or 'no', and if it is not specified, it is presumed that
      it is set to 'yes'.

    Note that the 'need', 'use', 'before' and 'after' dependeny types can have '*'
    as argument.  Having:

    depend() {
    	before *
    }

    will make the service start first in the current runlevel, and:

    depend() {
    	after *
    }

    will make the service the last to start.

    You should however be careful how you use this, as I really will not
    recommend using it with the 'need' or 'use' dependency type ... you have
    been warned!

${CYAN}'net' Dependency and 'net.*' Services:${OFF}
    Example:

    depend() {
        need net
    }

    This is a special dependency of type 'need'.  It represents a state where
    a network interface or interfaces besides lo is up and active.  Any service
    starting with 'net.' will be treated as a part of the 'net' dependency,
    if:

    1.  It is part of the 'boot' runlevel
    2.  It is part of the current runlevel

    A few examples are the /etc/init.d/net.eth0 and /etc/init.d/net.lo services.

${CYAN}Configuration files:${OFF}
    There are two files which will be sourced for possible configuration by
    the rc-scripts.  They are (sourced from top to bottom):

    /etc/conf.d/${myservice}
    /etc/rc.conf

${CYAN}Management:${OFF}
    Services are added and removed via the 'rc-update' tool.  Running it without
    arguments should give sufficient help.
