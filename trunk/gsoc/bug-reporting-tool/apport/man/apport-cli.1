.SH NAME

apport\-cli \- Command line client for reporting problems

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B apport\-cli \-c
.I report

.B apport\-cli \-f \-p
.I package

.B apport\-cli \-f \-P
.I pid

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B apport 
automatically collects data from crashed processes and compiles a problem
report in 
.I /var/crash/\fR. This is a command line frontend for reporting
those crashes to the developers. It can also be used to report bugs
about packages or running processes.

For desktop systems with a graphical user interface, you should
consider installing the GTK or KDE user interface (apport-gtk or
apport-kde).
.B apport\-cli
is mainly intended to be used on servers.

When called without any options, it processes the pending crash
reports and offers to report them one by one. You can also display the
entire report to see what is sent to the software developers.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-c \fIreport\fR, \fB\-\-crash\-file\fR=\fIreport
Instead of walking over the new crash reports in
.I /var/crash/\fR,
report a particular report in an arbitrary file location.
This is useful for copying a crash report to a machine with internet
connection and reporting it from there.

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-file\-bug
Report a (non-crash) problem. Requires specifying
.B \-\-package
or
.B \-\-pid\fR.
This will automatically attach information about your operating system
and the package version etc. to the bug report, so that the developers
have some important context.

.TP
.B \-p \fIpackage\fR, \fB\-\-package\fR=\fIpackage
When being used in
.B \-\-file\-bug
mode, specify the package to report the problem against.

.TP
.B \-P \fIpid\fR, \fB\-\-pid\fR=\fIpid
When being used in
.B \-\-file\-bug
mode, specify the PID (process ID) of a running program to report the
problem against. This can be determined with e. g.
.B ps -ux\fR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
.B APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not
current. If this environment variable is set, this check is waived. Experts who
will thoroughly check the situation before filing a bug report can define this
in their
.B ~/.bashrc
or temporarily when calling the apport frontend (\-cli, \-gtk, or \-kde).

.SH AUTHOR
.B apport
and the accompanying tools are developed by Martin Pitt
