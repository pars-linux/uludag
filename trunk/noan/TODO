== Needed ==

- released packages on stable repo
- reverted packages (removed from test)
- mark ACK'ed, NACK'ed and "dependencies not ACK'ed" packages
- Better user interface

- Filter, search, sort support
- Vote system for pending packages (ack/nack)

== Implementation Issues ==

- Extension repo support (for contrib)
    - Oh wait, contrib does not have a test repo!?

== FIXME ==

- Decide what to do with our home-page. Do not redirect it to repository app
- We handle ACK/NACK info in package listing page, maybe we can use different view?

- Profile page
    - Lost password section
