<p>
Pardus runs some services during boot-up. This process can be controlled by the end user, i.e some services can be disabled during boot and some can be enabled again. Service Manager can be used to administrate this task.
<p>
A led on the left of a service name shows the status of the corresponding service. If this led is red, then the service is not running. If it's green, then the service is currently running.
<p>
In order to run a stopped service, just click on the service and then the "Start" button on the bottom. Likewise, to start a service, it's enough to click on the service name and "Stop" button one after another.
