    <section id="sect-Release_Notes-How_Can_I_Try_Pardus">
        <title>How Can I Try Pardus?</title>
        <para>
            You can try Pardus either by installing it on your computer or running the Live version
            without touching your hard disk. You can boot Pardus from an optical drive as well as from
            USB mass storage devices like external hard drives and USB flash drives.
        </para>
        <para>
            Both the installation and live version images exceeds the size of a regular CD
            so if you are willing to use an optical drive for booting Pardus, you currently have to
            use DVD media to burn the images.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that the boot order in your system's BIOS software should be set with the optical drive
            or USB mass storage device as the first device in order to boot from the installation or
            the live medium. On newer systems, the boot order can also be changed by pressing a key
            (generally F8 on desktop systems) while booting.
