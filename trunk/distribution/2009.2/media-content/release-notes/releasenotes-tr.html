<h3>1.1. Pardus Nedir</h3>
Pardus is a Linux distribution developed as a product of the Pardus
Project, by National Research Institute of Electronics ve
Cryptology (UEKAE), which is under the Scientific and Technological
Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and by volunteered
contributors. It is named after the Latin (and scientific) name for
the Anatolian leopard, Panthera pardus tulliana.<br>
<br>
Pardus consists of a Linux based operating system, opensource
applications and related data files necessary for desktop and
server environments, aiming to provide users stable, reliable, easy
to use and feature rich computer experience.
<h3>1.2. Nasıl Kullanabilirim</h3>
Pardus comes with two flavours, Kurulan (which installs Pardus to
your computer) or Çalışan (live media, running on the media only,
slower but does not install on your computer) and can be started
from a CD / DVD / External storage (USB stick for example) or can
be installed to internal harddisk depending on your preference.<br>
<br>
Çalışan (live) image and Kurulan (installation) images contain
support for English and Turkish languages, and can fit on one CD.
International image is a multilanguage image (including Turkish)
contains language packages, some applications and artwork that are
not included in Kurulan image. International image is about 1GB in
size, and can be written on a DVD or harddisk like media like a USB
stick.<br>
<br>
To start your Pardus experience, you need to insert the related
media in your computer, reboot the system and set up your computer

<h2>2. Neler yeni ?</h2>
<h3>2.1. Pardus Teknolojilerindeki Yenilikler</h3>
Core Pardus technologies are updated to new versions, including
many bugfixes, optimizations and new features.<br>
<br>
Pardus manager family has been refactored and optimized for new KDE
4.4 / Qt 4.6 environments. Pardus KDE tools, Network Plasmoid for
easy network profile switching and Service Plasmoid for easy
service management are available in our repositories. These
plasmoids can be placed either on the desktop, or any of the panels
on the desktop for easier access.<br>
<br>
A new KDE tool <strong>plasma-runner-pisi</strong> has been added
to provide easy package installation in KDE environment. Under KDE
environment, when you start up krunner (default by pressing ALT-F2)
and write a command that is not available on the running system but
provided by a package in Pardus repositories, an entry to install
the necessary package will appear. Simply selecting the entry will
automatically install the required package.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paket Yöneticisi</strong> and <strong>PiSi</strong> have
been optimized for better performance and improved stability. PiSi
interface has been refactored for easier use. Package Manager went
through heavy refactoring and is now using <strong>Pardus Desktop
Services</strong>, which allows the GUI to run on desktop
environments other than KDE 4 without the necessity of any KDE
library. Among performance enhancements on the GUI, Package Manager
now supports update types. Type of the updates are shown next to
packages and users can select group of updates (security for
example) easily from the Package Manager GUI.<br>
<br>
Pardus welcome wizard Kaptan has also been refactored for the new
Pardus release. With new graphical changes, Kaptan is more user
friendly then ever, especially on small displays like netbooks.
<h3>2.2. Görsel Değişiklikler</h3>
Like other Pardus releases, this new release comes with the theme
and name of species that is in danger of extinction. With new
packages added to repositories, GTK and KDE integration is improved

also updated with new icons. Older wallpapers released withing
Pardus 2009 family can also be installed from package repositories.
<h3>2.3. KDE 4 Masaüstü Ortamı</h3>
Default desktop environment is updated to <strong>KDE
4.4.3</strong>, the latest stable release of KDE that has been
