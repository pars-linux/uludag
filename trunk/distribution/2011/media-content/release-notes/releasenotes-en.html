<h3>1.1. What is Pardus?</h3>

Pardus is a Linux distribution developed as a product of the Pardus Project, by National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE), which is under the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and by volunteered contributors. It is named after the Latin (and scientific) name for the Anatolian leopard, Panthera pardus tulliana.

Pardus consists of a Linux based operating system, opensource applications and related data files necessary for desktop and server environments, aiming to provide users stable, reliable, easy to use and feature rich computer experience.

<h3>1.2. How Can I Use Pardus?</h3>

Pardus comes with two flavours, Kurulan (which installs Pardus to your computer) or Çalışan (live media, running on the media only, slower but does not install on your computer) and can be started from a DVD / External storage (USB stick for example) or can be installed to internal harddisk depending on your preference.

To start your Pardus experience, you need to insert the related media in your computer, reboot the system and set up your computer BIOS to boot from the Pardus media.
