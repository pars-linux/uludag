Sinerji is a fronted for Synergy. 

From synergy homepage's :
Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers with different operating systems, 
each with its own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with multiple computers on their desk 
since each system uses its own monitor(s). 

Synergy run's only in background and do not have a configurable gui. That's the reason wyh Sinerji is written.
It's written in PyQt4 and uses Avahi and Dbus as backend. With avahi-support it's able to discover other Synergy users.
After discovering just apply the configuration, Sinerji will create automatically synergy.conf and will start the synergy server.
On the other hand, if nothing is applied, it will also search for servers who want to admin other client. If you are client,
it will automatically popup a notification, which will ask you to accept or reject the request from the server.
